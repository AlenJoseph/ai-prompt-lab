    "gpt-5": "# Step-by-step beginner explanation (Python)\n\nCode:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(i)\n```\n\n1. **`range(3)` — makes a sequence of numbers**\n\n   * `range(3)` produces the numbers `0, 1, 2`.\n   * Important: it **starts at 0** and goes up to **but does not include** 3.\n\n2. **`for i in range(3):` — starts a loop**\n\n   * `for` tells Python to repeat a block of code for every item in the sequence.\n   * `i` is the loop variable. On each iteration `i` takes the next value from the sequence (`0`, then `1`, then `2`).\n   * The colon `:` marks the start of the loop body.\n\n3. **Indentation — groups the loop body**\n\n   * The indented line(s) under the `for` are the actions run each iteration. Python uses indentation to define blocks.\n\n4. **`print(i)` — action run each time**\n\n   * On each loop iteration Python runs `print(i)`, which outputs the current value of `i`, then moves to the next line.\n\n5. **What actually happens (iteration-by-iteration trace)**\n   | Iteration | `i` value | Output printed |\n   |---:|---:|---|\n   | 1 | 0 | `0` |\n   | 2 | 1 | `1` |\n   | 3 | 2 | `2` |\n\nFinal console output:\n\n```\n0\n1\n2\n```\n\n6. **Why it runs 3 times**\n\n   * Because `range(3)` contains three numbers (0,1,2) — one loop iteration per number.\n\n7. **Common variations**\n\n   * `range(5)` → prints `0` through `4`.\n   * `range(1,4)` → prints `1, 2, 3` (start and stop).\n   * Multi-line loop body:\n\n     ```python\n     for i in range(3):\n         doubled = i * 2\n         print(i, doubled)\n     ```\n\n8. **Common beginner mistakes**\n\n   * Forgetting the colon `:` after the `for` line → SyntaxError.\n   * Not indenting the body correctly → IndentationError or unexpected behavior.\n   * Expecting `range(3)` to include `3` — remember it stops *before* the stop value.\n\n9. **Quick exercise**\n\n   * Change to `for i in range(4): print(\"Hello\", i)` — what prints? (Answer: `Hello 0` ... `Hello 3`)\n\nWould you like a visual trace (step table) as code output, or an explanation of how to loop over other collections like lists and strings?",

    "gemini-2.5": "Of course! This code is a fundamental concept in Python called a **for loop**. It's used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of `for i in range(3): print(i)`:\n\n### 1. `for i in ...`\n\nThis part starts the loop. Think of it as saying, \"For each item in the following sequence, I want you to do something.\"\n\n  * `for`: This is the keyword that begins the loop.\n  * `i`: This is a **variable**. You can name it almost anything (like `number`, `x`, etc.), but `i` (short for index) is a common convention. Its job is to hold the current item from the sequence as the loop runs.\n\n### 2. `range(3)`\n\nThis part creates the sequence of numbers that the loop will go through.\n\n  * `range(3)` is a function that generates a sequence of numbers starting from **0** up to, but **not including**, the number in the parentheses.\n  * So, `range(3)` produces the numbers: **0, 1, 2**.\n\nIt's like telling Python, \"I need a sequence of 3 numbers, please start at 0.\"\n\n### 3. `:` and `print(i)`\n\nThis is the \"do something\" part of the loop.\n\n  * The colon `:` at the end of the first line tells Python, \"Okay, here comes the block of code I want you to repeat.\"\n  * `print(i)` is the action to be repeated. The `print()` function displays whatever is inside its parentheses on the screen. In this case, it will print the current value of the variable `i`.\n\n### How It Executes ▶️\n\nThe code runs through the sequence generated by `range(3)` one number at a time.\n\n  * **Iteration 1:** The loop starts. The first number from `range(3)` is **0**. Python assigns this value to `i`. So, `i` is now `0`. The code inside the loop runs: `print(i)` prints **0**.\n  * **Iteration 2:** The loop goes to the next number in the sequence, which is **1**. Python assigns this value to `i`. So, `i` is now `1`. The code `print(i)` prints **1**.\n  * **Iteration 3:** The loop goes to the last number in the sequence, which is **2**. Python assigns this value to `i`. So, `i` is now `2`. The code `print(i)` prints **2**.\n\nAfter printing 2, the loop sees there are no more numbers in the sequence from `range(3)`, so it stops.\n\n### Final Output\n\nThe final output on the screen will be:\n\n```\n0\n1\n2\n```",

    "claude-3": "# Understanding the Python Code\nLet me break down this simple but important Python code step by step:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(i)\n```\n\n**What this code does:** It prints the numbers 0, 1, and 2 on separate lines.\n\n## Step-by-Step Breakdown\n\n**1. The `for` loop**\nThe word `for` tells Python that we want to repeat something multiple times. It's a way to do the same action over and over without writing the code multiple times.\n\n**2. The variable `i`**\nThis is a variable (a container that holds a value) that will change each time the loop repeats. Think of it as a counter that keeps track of which repetition we're on.\n\n**3. The `range(3)` part**\n`range(3)` means \"give me a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) 3.\" So it creates: 0, 1, 2. That's three numbers total, which is why we use `range(3)`.\n\n**4. The colon `:`**\nThe colon tells Python \"here comes the code I want to repeat.\"\n\n**5. The `print(i)` line**\nThis is the code that repeats. The `print()` function displays whatever is inside the parentheses. So it will print the current value of `i`.\n\n## How It Executes\n\n- **First repetition:** `i` becomes 0 → `print(0)` → displays \"0\"\n- **Second repetition:** `i` becomes 1 → `print(1)` → displays \"1\"\n- **Third repetition:** `i` becomes 2 → `print(2)` → displays \"2\"\n- **Loop ends:** No more numbers in `range(3)`, so the loop stops\n\n**Output:**\n```\n0\n1\n2\n```\n\nThis is a fundamental pattern in programming—repeating code a specific number of times without having to write it out each time!"
