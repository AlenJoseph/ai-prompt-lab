Building a simple login system is an excellent way to learn core Python concepts like file handling, functions, and basic security (password hashing).\n\nI've prepared two files for you: the Python script that contains the entire system logic, and a detailed Markdown tutorial that walks you through setting it up and running it from start to finish.\n\n(Full Gemini code and explanation content continues here...)",
