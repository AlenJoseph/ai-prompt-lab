    "gpt-5": "Sure! Let’s make learning **HTML** (the language of websites) fun and super easy to understand 😄\n\n---\n\n### 🌐 What is HTML?\n\n**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**.\nIt’s the language that tells a **web browser** what to show on a webpage.\n\nThink of it like **building with LEGO** —\neach block (called a **tag**) helps you build parts of a web page like:\n\n* A heading 🏷️\n* A paragraph 📝\n* A picture 🖼️\n* A link 🔗\n\nSo HTML is how you tell the computer:\n\n> “Hey, show this title, then a picture, then some words!”\n\n---\n\n### 💻 Example\n\nHere’s a small HTML program:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>My First Web Page</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>\n    <p>My name is Alex, and I love pizza 🍕</p>\n    <img src=\"https://example.com/pizza.jpg\" alt=\"Yummy Pizza\" width=\"200\">\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n#### 🧠 What it does:\n\n* `<h1>` makes a **big heading**: \"Hello, World!\"\n* `<p>` makes a **paragraph** of text.\n* `<img>` shows a **picture** of pizza!\n\nWhen you open this in a browser, you’ll see:\n👉 A big “Hello, World!”\n👉 A line that says “My name is Alex, and I love pizza 🍕”\n👉 A yummy pizza picture below it 🍕\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 Fun Activity 1: “Make Your Own Webpage!”\n\n1. Open **Notepad** (on Windows) or **TextEdit** (on Mac).\n2. Type the example HTML code above.\n3. Save it as **mypage.html** on your desktop.\n4. Double-click the file — it will open in your browser!\n\n🎉 Congrats! You just made your first website!\n\n---\n\n### 🎨 Fun Activity 2: “Decorate Your Page!”\n\nNow, change it up! Try these:\n\n* Change `<h1>` to say your **name**.\n* Add another `<p>` that says your **favorite color or animal**.\n* Add an image of your favorite **cartoon character** using `<img>`.\n\nExample:\n\n```html\n<h1>Hi, I'm Maya!</h1>\n<p>My favorite color is purple 💜</p>\n<img src=\"https://example.com/unicorn.jpg\" alt=\"Unicorn\">\n```\n\n---\n\n### 🌟 Summary\n\n* **HTML** is how we tell computers what a web page should look like.\n* **Tags** are like building blocks.\n* You can make **headings, paragraphs, pictures, and links**.\n* Anyone — even you — can build a web page! 🚀\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to make a **printable “HTML for Kids” worksheet** with these activities and blank spaces for writing code?",
    "gemini-2.5": "Hello! That's a great question! Let's talk about **HTML**! 🤩\n\nHTML is like the **skeleton** of a website. Just like your skeleton holds up your body and gives it shape, HTML holds up a website and tells the computer **what things are** and **where they should go**.\n\n---\n\n## 🦴 What is HTML?\n\nHTML stands for **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage.\n\n* **It's a language** that computers use to talk to each other and build web pages.\n* It uses special words, called **tags**, inside **angle brackets** like `<p>` or `<h1>`. These tags act like labels or instructions.\n* These tags tell the web browser (like Chrome or Safari) what each piece of content is. For example: \"This is a **heading**,\" \"This is a **paragraph**,\" or \"This is an **image**.\"\n\n---\n\n## 📝 An Example of How it Works\n\nImagine you are writing a letter.\n\n| What you Write in HTML | What the Computer Shows on the Screen |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| `<h1>My Favorite Robot</h1>` | **My Favorite Robot** (Big, main title) |\n| `<p>I like robots because they can fly.</p>` | I like robots because they can fly. (Regular text) |\n| `<img src=\"robot.jpg\">` | (An actual picture of a robot) |\n\n**What it does:** It takes those tags and turns them into a structured, readable webpage that you can see and click on!\n\n---\n\n## 🥳 Fun Activity 1: The LEGO Analogy\n\nThink of HTML tags like different **types of LEGO bricks**:\n\n* The `<p>` tag is like a **long, flat brick** for making a sentence.\n* The `<h1>` tag is like a **big, chunky brick** for making a sign.\n* The `<img>` tag is like a **special brick with a picture** on it.\n\nYour job as an HTML coder is to choose the **right bricks (tags)** and put them together in the **right order** to build your webpage!\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 Fun Activity 2: Secret Codes\n\nLet's write a secret HTML message. You can try to write one too!\n\n1. Write a message on a piece of paper.\n2. Use these **secret codes (tags)** to label parts of your message:\n   * Put a big title inside `<h1>` and `</h1>`.\n   * Put a sentence inside `<p>` and `</p>`.\n   * Put a special important word inside `<b>` and `</b>` (The 'b' means **bold**).\n\n**Example:**\n\n```html\n<h1>My Top Secret Pet</h1>\n<p>I have a pet that is a <b>friendly dragon</b>.</p>\n```\n\nWhen you show this to a computer, it knows to make the title big and make the words \"friendly dragon\" stand out! You've just learned how to **mark up** text!\n\nWould you like to try writing a short HTML message for a webpage?",
    "claude-3": "# HTML for Kids\n\nHTML is like the **instructions for building a webpage**. Imagine you're building with blocks—HTML tells the computer which blocks to use and where to put them.\n\nWhen you visit a website, HTML creates all the stuff you see: the titles, the pictures, the buttons, and the text. It's like the skeleton of a building—it holds everything together and gives it shape.\n\n## How HTML Works\n\nThink of HTML like a recipe. A recipe says:\n- First, put in eggs\n- Then, add flour\n- Mix it together\n- Bake at 350 degrees\n\nHTML does something similar. It says:\n- Put a big title here\n- Put a picture there\n- Put a paragraph of text below that\n\nThe computer reads these instructions and shows you the webpage exactly as the HTML describes it.\n\n## Fun Activity 1: Make Your Own Webpage Title\n\nHere's a simple HTML example:\n\n```html\n<h1>My Awesome Website</h1>\n<p>Welcome to my page!</p>\n```\n\nWhen you put this in HTML, it creates a big title that says \"My Awesome Website\" and below it shows \"Welcome to my page!\" Try changing the words and see how it looks!\n\n## Fun Activity 2: HTML Scavenger Hunt\n\nVisit any website you like (like a game site or YouTube). Then right-click and choose \"View Page Source.\" You'll see a bunch of HTML code! Try to find words you recognize—like your favorite game title or a word from the page. All that text you see on the website started as HTML instructions!"
