    "gemini-2.5":  "Of course. The provided Python code has two common syntax errors that are crucial for beginners to understand.\n\nHere are the errors and the corrected code:\n\n### The Errors üêû\n\n1. **Missing Colon (`:`)** ‚Äî In Python, the line that starts a loop (like `for` or `while`) or a conditional statement (like `if`) must always end with a **colon (`:`)**. This tells Python that a new block of code is about to begin.\n2. **Indentation Error** ‚Äî Python uses indentation (spaces) to group statements together. The code you want to run inside the `for` loop must be indented beneath it. Since the `print()` statement isn't indented, Python will raise an `IndentationError`.\n\n---\n\n### ‚úÖ Corrected Code\n\n```python\n# Added colon and indented the loop body\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(\"Number:\", i)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `for` loop iterates over numbers `0` through `4`.\n* Each time, it prints the word `'Number:'` followed by the current number.\n\n**Output:**\n```\nNumber: 0\nNumber: 1\nNumber: 2\nNumber: 3\nNumber: 4\n```",
    "claude-3": "# Error Analysis: Python Code\n\n## The Code with Errors\n```python\nfor i in range(5)\n    print(\"Number:\", i)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Error Found\n\n**Missing Colon (`:`) after the `for` statement**\n\n**Location:** End of line 1\n\n**Explanation:** In Python, all control structures like `for` loops, `if` statements, and `while` loops must end with a colon (`:`). The colon tells Python that you're about to define a block of code that belongs to that statement. Without it, Python doesn't know where the loop declaration ends and the loop body begins.\n\n**Error Message You'd See:**\n```\nSyntaxError: expected ':'\n```\n\n---\n\n## Fixed Code\n\n```python\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(\"Number:\", i)\n```\n\n**What changed:** Added a colon (`:`) at the end of the `for` statement.\n\n---\n\n## How the Fixed Code Works\n\nOnce corrected, this code will:\n1. Loop through numbers 0 to 4 (five iterations total)\n2. Print each number with the label \"Number:\"\n\n**Output:**\n```\nNumber: 0\nNumber: 1\nNumber: 2\nNumber: 3\nNumber: 4\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaway\n\n**Always remember:** In Python, `for` loops, `if` statements, `while` loops, function definitions (`def`), and class definitions (`class`) all require a colon at the end of their declaration line. This is followed by an indented block of code that belongs to that structure."
