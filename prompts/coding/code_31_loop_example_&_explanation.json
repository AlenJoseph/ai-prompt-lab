Without this, `printf` may not be declared.\n\n2. (blank line)\n   — Improves readability; has no effect on program behavior.\n\n3. `int main(void) {`\n   — The program’s entry point. `main` returns an `int`. `void` means it takes no arguments.\n\n4. `    int i;`\n   — Declares an integer variable `i` which we will use as the loop counter.\n\n5. `    for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {`\n   — Begins a `for` loop with three parts:\n   * **Initialization** `i = 1`: set `i` to 1 before the loop starts.\n   * **Condition** `i <= 5`: before each iteration, check this; if true, run the loop body, otherwise exit the loop.\n   * **Increment** `i++`: after each loop body execution, add 1 to `i` (post-increment).\n\n6. `        printf(\"%d\\n\", i);`\n   — Prints the current value of `i` followed by a newline. On successive iterations this will print 1, then 2, … up to 5.\n\n7. `    }`\n   — Closes the `for` loop block. Control returns to the `for` header to evaluate the increment and condition.\n\n8. `    return 0;`\n   — Returns 0 from `main`, a convention that indicates the program finished successfully.\n\n9. `}`\n   — Closes the `main` function.\n\nYou can compile and run this with (example): `gcc -o print12345 program.c && ./print12345` — it will output:\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n```",
    "gemini-2.5": "Hello! I'd be happy to show you how to print numbers 1 to 5 using a `for` loop in C, along with a detailed line-by-line explanation.\n\n## 💻 C Code: Printing 1 to 5\n\nHere is the complete C code:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int i;\n\n    // Loop to print numbers from 1 to 5\n    for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", i);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n-----\n\n## 🧐 Line-by-Line Explanation\n\n| Code Line | Explanation |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **`#include <stdio.h>`** | This is a **preprocessor directive** that tells the C compiler to include the contents of the `stdio.h` header file. This file provides the function `printf()`, which we use to print output to the console. |\n| **`int main() {`** | This is the **main function** where the program execution begins. Every C program must have a `main` function. The `int` indicates that the function will return an integer value upon completion. |\n| **`int i;`** | This line **declares an integer variable** named `i`. This variable will be used as the **loop counter** (or iterator). |\n| **`for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {`** | This is the **`for` loop statement**, which controls the repetition. It has three parts separated by semicolons: |\n| | 1. **`i = 1`** (**Initialization**): Sets the starting value of the loop counter `i` to **1**. This happens only once at the start. |\n| | 2. **`i <= 5`** (**Condition**): Checked before each iteration. The loop continues to run as long as this condition is **true** (i is less than or equal to 5). |\n| | 3. **`i++`** (**Update**): Executed after each iteration of the loop body. It **increments** the value of `i` by 1 (`i++` is short for `i = i + 1`). |\n| **`printf(\"%d\\n\", i);`** | This is the **body of the loop**. It executes in each iteration. It uses the `printf()` function to print: |\n| | - **`%d`**: A format specifier that tells `printf` to print the value of an integer. |\n| | - **`i`**: The variable whose value is to be printed (i.e., the current number). |\n| | - **`\\n`**: A newline character, which moves the cursor to the next line after printing the number, ensuring each number is on a separate line. |\n| **`}`** | This **closes the `for` loop body**. After this, execution jumps back to the **Update** part (`i++`) of the `for` loop. |\n| **`return 0;`** | Indicates that the program has **executed successfully** and returns the integer value **0** to the operating system. |\n| **`}`** | This **closes the `main` function**. |\n\n-----\n\n## 🏃 Execution Flow\n\n1.  **Start:** `i` is initialized to **1**.\n2.  **Check:** Is 1 <= 5? **Yes**.\n3.  **Execute:** Print 1.\n4.  **Update:** `i` becomes 2.\n5.  **Check:** Is 2 <= 5? **Yes**.\n6.  **Execute:** Print 2.\n7.  **Update:** `i` becomes 3.\n8.  **Check:** Is 3 <= 5? **Yes**.\n9.  **Execute:** Print 3.\n10. **Update:** `i` becomes 4.\n11. **Check:** Is 4 <= 5? **Yes**.\n12. **Execute:** Print 4.\n13. **Update:** `i` becomes 5.\n14. **Check:** Is 5 <= 5? **Yes**.\n15. **Execute:** Print 5.\n16. **Update:** `i` becomes 6.\n17. **Check:** Is 6 <= 5? **No**.\n18. **End:** The loop terminates, and the program exits.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n```",
    "claude-3": "Here's the line-by-line explanation:\n\n**Line 1: `#include <stdio.h>`**\nThis is a preprocessor directive that includes the standard input/output library.
