    "gpt-5": "Sure! Let’s break down **Bubble Sort** in simple terms:\n\n---\n\n### **Concept**\n\nBubble Sort is like **sorting a row of numbered cards** in order. You repeatedly compare **two neighboring cards** and swap them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until all the cards are sorted.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Process**\n\n1. **Start at the beginning** of the array (or list).\n2. **Compare the first two elements**:\n   - If the first element is **greater** than the second, **swap** them.\n   - Otherwise, leave them as is.\n3. **Move to the next pair** and repeat the comparison and swap.\n4. Keep doing this until you reach the **end of the array**.\n   - After this first pass, the **largest element “bubbles up”** to the last position.\n5. **Repeat the whole process** for the rest of the array (excluding the last element, which is already sorted).\n6. Continue until **no swaps are needed** in a full pass, which means the array is sorted.\n\n---\n\n### **Example**\n\nArray: `[5, 3, 8, 4]`\n\n- **First pass**:\n  1. Compare 5 & 3 → swap → `[3, 5, 8, 4]`\n  2. Compare 5 & 8 → no swap → `[3, 5, 8, 4]`\n  3. Compare 8 & 4 → swap → `[3, 5, 4, 8]`\n- **Second pass**:\n  1. Compare 3 & 5 → no swap → `[3, 5, 4, 8]`\n  2. Compare 5 & 4 → swap → `[3, 4, 5, 8]`\n  3. Compare 5 & 8 → no swap → `[3, 4, 5, 8]`\n- **Third pass**:\n  1. Compare 3 & 4 → no swap\n  2. Compare 4 & 5 → no swap\n- Since no swaps were needed, **array is sorted**: `[3, 4, 5, 8]`\n\n---\n\n### **Key Points**\n\n- Simple and easy to understand.\n- Works by **repeatedly bubbling up the largest number** to the end.\n- **Time complexity:** O(n²) in worst case (slow for large arrays).\n- **Space complexity:** O(1) because it sorts in-place.\n\n---\n\n✅ You can imagine Bubble Sort like bubbles in water: bigger numbers rise to the top (end of the list) while smaller numbers sink toward the bottom (beginning of the list).",
    "gemini-2.5": "The **Bubble Sort** algorithm is a simple sorting technique that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It's called \"Bubble Sort\" because with each pass, the largest unsorted element \"bubbles up\" to its correct position at the end of the list.\n\n---\n\n## How it Works\n\n1. Start at the beginning of the list and compare the **first two adjacent elements**.\n2. If the first element is **greater** than the second (for ascending order), **swap them**. Otherwise, leave them as is.\n3. Move to the next pair and repeat the comparison and swap until the end of the list.\n4. After one complete pass, the **largest element** will have \"bubbled up\" to its correct position at the end.\n5. Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted elements.\n6. Stop when a pass completes **without any swaps**, meaning the list is sorted.\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nList: `[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]`\n\n**Pass 1:**\n- Compare 5 & 1 → Swap → `[1, 5, 4, 2, 8]`\n- Compare 5 & 4 → Swap → `[1, 4, 5, 2, 8]`\n- Compare 5 & 2 → Swap → `[1, 4, 2, 5, 8]`\n- Compare 5 & 8 → No swap → `[1, 4, 2, 5, 8]`\n\n**Pass 2:**\n- Compare 1 & 4 → No swap → `[1, 4, 2, 5, 8]`\n- Compare 4 & 2 → Swap → `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8]`\n- Compare 4 & 5 → No swap → `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8]`\n\n**Pass 3:**\n- Compare 1 & 2 → No swap\n- Compare 2 & 4 → No swap\n- List is sorted: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8]`\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaway:** Bubble Sort is easy to understand but inefficient for large lists due to O(n²) time complexity.",
    "claude-3": "Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms.\n\n**The Basic Idea:**\nImagine a list of numbers you want to arrange from smallest to largest. Bubble Sort repeatedly goes through the list, compares neighboring pairs, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The largest numbers gradually \"bubble up\" to the end.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n1. Start at the beginning of the list.\n2. Compare the first two numbers.\n3. If the first number is bigger than the second, swap them.\n4. Move to the next pair and repeat steps 2-3.\n5. Continue to the end of the list. The largest number is now in the correct position.\n6. Repeat from the beginning with the remaining unsorted numbers.\n7. Stop when no more swaps are needed.\n\n**Example:**\nList: `[5, 2, 8, 1]`\n- First pass: `[2, 5, 8, 1]`, then `[2, 5, 1, 8]` → 8 is in place.\n- Second pass: `[2, 1, 5, 8]` → 5 is in place.\n- Third pass: `[1, 2, 5, 8]` → sorted.\n\n**Why It's Called \"Bubble\":** Larger numbers move to the end like bubbles rising, smaller numbers sink toward the beginning.\n\n**Takeaway:** Bubble Sort is easy to understand and implement, but slow for large lists due to O(n²) complexity."
