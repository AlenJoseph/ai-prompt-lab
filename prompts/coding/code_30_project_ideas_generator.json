    "gpt-5": "Here are **5 beginner-friendly React project ideas** with short descriptions 👇\n\n---\n\n### 1. 📝 **To-Do List App**\n**Description:**\nBuild a simple app where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. You’ll learn React state management (`useState`), conditional rendering, and basic form handling. You can later enhance it with localStorage to save tasks.\n\n---\n\n### 2. 🌦️ **Weather Dashboard**\n**Description:**\nCreate a weather app that fetches real-time weather data from a public API (like OpenWeatherMap). This project teaches you how to make API calls with `fetch` or `axios`, handle asynchronous data, and display dynamic UI updates.\n\n---\n\n### 3. 🎬 **Movie Search App**\n**Description:**\nUse the OMDB API or TMDB API to let users search for movies and view details such as ratings, release date, and posters. You’ll practice working with API responses, React props, and list rendering.\n\n---\n\n### 4. 🛒 **Simple Shopping Cart**\n**Description:**\nBuild a small e-commerce demo with product listings, a shopping cart, and a checkout summary. You’ll learn about state lifting, `useReducer`, and component-based UI design.\n\n---\n\n### 5. 💬 **Chat Simulator**\n**Description:**\nCreate a basic “chatbox” where a user sends messages and receives automated replies (using dummy logic or a chatbot API). Great for learning about controlled inputs, arrays in state, and rendering message lists dynamically.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to rank these by **learning value** or **ease of implementation** for a complete beginner?",
    
    "gemini-2.5": "Here are 5 project ideas using React that are suitable for beginner web developers, focusing on core concepts like components, state, and props.\n\n## 5 Beginner React Project Ideas\n\n---\n\n### 1. To-Do List Application 📝\n**Description:**\nA classic project that involves creating, reading, updating, and deleting (**CRUD** operations) tasks. This project is perfect for learning how to manage **state** (the list of to-dos) using the `useState` hook, handling **user input** from forms, and rendering **lists of components** using the `map()` function.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Basic Calculator App 🔢\n**Description:**\nDevelop a calculator that can perform simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). This helps solidify your understanding of **event handling** (button clicks), managing multiple pieces of state (current input and result), and writing **JavaScript logic** within a React component.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Recipe Finder App (with Mock Data) 🍲\n**Description:**\nBuild an application that displays a list of recipes. Start by using a **local array of JavaScript objects** as your 'mock' data source instead of an external API. This is an excellent exercise in **component composition** (having a main app, a recipe list, and individual recipe card components) and using **props** to pass data down the component tree.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Color Picker/Changer 🎨\n**Description:**\nAn app where a user can change the background color of a main container using an input field, a set of pre-defined buttons, or a random color generator button. This project focuses entirely on **state management** and using the state value to **dynamically style** the UI, illustrating how React efficiently updates the DOM based on state changes.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Simple Quiz App ❓\n**Description:**\nCreate a multiple-choice quiz with a few questions. The user selects an answer and moves to the next question. At the end, display the final score. This is great for learning about **conditional rendering** (showing the question screen vs. the results screen), handling form submissions, and managing a more complex piece of **state** (the current question index and the score).\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to provide a list of the **core React concepts** you would learn from one of these specific projects?",
    
    "claude-3": "Here are 5 great React project ideas for beginners:\n\n**1. Todo List App**\nBuild a classic todo application where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. This teaches you state management with `useState`, handling form inputs, and rendering dynamic lists. You can enhance it by adding features like filtering (all/active/completed) or local storage persistence.\n\n**2. Weather App**\nCreate a weather application that fetches data from a free weather API (like OpenWeatherMap). Users enter a city name and see current conditions, temperature, and a forecast. This project teaches you how to work with APIs, handle loading states, and manage async data fetching with `useEffect`.\n\n**3. Quiz Game**\nBuild an interactive quiz where users answer multiple-choice questions and receive a score at the end. You can hardcode questions or fetch them from a quiz API. This teaches you conditional rendering, state management for tracking answers, and handling user interactions.\n\n**4. Expense Tracker**\nCreate an app where users can log expenses with categories, amounts, and dates. Display a summary showing total spending and breakdown by category. This project reinforces form handling, state management, and introduces you to displaying data with charts or organized lists.\n\n**5. Random Quote Generator**\nBuild a simple app that displays random quotes with an author attribution. Add a button to generate a new quote and a button to share it on social media. This is a lightweight project perfect for learning API integration, basic styling, and simple interactivity without overwhelming complexity.\n\nEach of these projects helps you practice core React concepts while building something tangible you can show others. Start with whichever sounds most interesting to you!"
