    "gpt-5": "Sure! Let’s make this super simple and fun. 😄\n\n---\n\n### **What is a `for loop`?**\n\nA `for loop` is like a **robot that does a job over and over again** for each item in a list or a range of numbers. Instead of doing the same thing again and again by hand, the robot does it for you automatically.\n\n**Analogy:**\nImagine you have **5 candies** in a row, and you want to **say \"Yum!\" for each candy**. Instead of saying \"Yum!\" 5 times yourself, you tell a robot:\n\n> “Hey robot, for each candy in this row, say ‘Yum!’”\n\nThe robot goes candy by candy and says \"Yum!\" each time. That’s exactly what a `for loop` does in Python.\n\n---\n\n### **Simple Python Example**\n\n```python\ncandies = [\"chocolate\", \"gummy bear\", \"lollipop\", \"jelly\", \"mint\"]\n\nfor candy in candies:\n    print(\"Yum! I love\", candy)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nYum! I love chocolate\nYum! I love gummy bear\nYum! I love lollipop\nYum! I love jelly\nYum! I love mint\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Another fun example using numbers**\n\n```python\nfor i in range(5):  # range(5) is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n    print(\"I have\", i, \"toy(s)!\")\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nI have 0 toy(s)!\nI have 1 toy(s)!\nI have 2 toy(s)!\nI have 3 toy(s)!\nI have 4 toy(s)!\n```\n\n---\n\n✅ **Key points to remember:**\n\n* A `for loop` **repeats actions** for every item in a list or numbers in a range.\n* The variable after `for` (like `candy` or `i`) **changes automatically** in each step.\n* The code inside the loop (indented) is what gets repeated.",
    
    "gemini-2.5": "That's a great question! \"For loops\" in Python are like helpful little robots that do repetitive tasks. 🤖\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 The Robot Analogy\n\nImagine you have a big pile of your favorite **toys** (this is like a **list** of things in Python). You want your robot to pick up *each* toy, one by one, and put it into the toy box.\n\nA **for loop** is the instruction you give the robot: **\"For every single toy in the pile, do this action.\"**\n\nThe robot will:\n1. Pick up the first toy.\n2. Do the action (e.g., say its name, put it in the box).\n3. Go back to the pile.\n4. Pick up the next toy.\n5. Repeat until the pile is empty!\n\n---\n\n## 🐍 How it Works in Python\n\nIn Python, the 'pile of toys' is usually something called an **\"iterable\"**—like a **list** of numbers, a string of letters, or a range of numbers.\n\nThe **for loop** tells the computer to take a variable (like our robot's hand, which we'll call `item` or `number`) and assign it to *each thing* in the list, one at a time, and run the code inside the loop.\n\n### Simple Code Example\n\n```python\nfavorite_snacks = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"grape\", \"cookie\"]\n\nfor snack in favorite_snacks:\n    print(\"I love to eat \" + snack + \"!\")\n```\n\n**Step by step:**\n1. `for snack in favorite_snacks:` → Python picks the first item and puts it in `snack`.\n2. `print(\"I love to eat \" + snack + \"!\")` → Prints the message.\n3. Moves to the next item, repeats until the list is done.\n\nA **for loop** just repeats actions for **everything** in a collection.",
    
    "claude-3": "Imagine you have a toy box with 5 action figures, and you want to give each one a high-five. Instead of saying \"high-five figure 1, high-five figure 2, high-five figure 3...\", you could just say: \"High-five every figure in the box!\"\n\nA **for loop** does exactly that with code. It says \"do this action for each thing in a list.\"\n\n### Simple Example\n\n```python\ntoys = [\"bear\", \"robot\", \"dinosaur\", \"car\"]\n\nfor toy in toys:\n    print(\"I love my \" + toy)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nI love my bear\nI love my robot\nI love my dinosaur\nI love my car\n```\n\n**How It Works:**\n- The loop goes through the list one item at a time.\n- Each time, it does whatever is inside the loop.\n- When it runs out of items, it stops.\n\nThink of it like going through a stack of birthday presents:\n1. Pick up the first present → \"It's a toy robot!\"\n2. Pick up the second → \"It's a video game!\"\n3. Pick up the third → \"It's a book!\"\n4. Done!\n\nThe cool thing is, if you had 4 toys or 400 toys, you'd write the exact same code—the loop just repeats as many times as needed. ✨"
