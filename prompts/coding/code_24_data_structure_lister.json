    "gemini-2.5": "C is a versatile language, and while it doesn't have built-in classes for complex data structures like some other languages, they are commonly implemented using arrays, pointers, and structs. Here are three fundamental C data structures:\n\n## 💾 C Data Structures\n\n| Data Structure Name | Description | Examples (Implementation Concept) | Time Complexity (Common Operations) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Array** | A collection of items of the **same data type** stored at **contiguous memory locations**. Access is done via an index. | `int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};` (Fixed-size sequence of integers) | **Access:** $O(1)$ |\n| **Linked List** | A linear collection of data elements (called **nodes**), where each node points to the next node in the sequence. Nodes do **not** need to be in contiguous memory. | Implementing a **stack** or **queue** where elements are dynamically added/removed. | **Insertion/Deletion (at known position):** $O(1)$ |\n| **Hash Table** | An array of linked lists (or arrays, etc.) designed to store key-value pairs. It uses a **hash function** to compute an index into the array where the value is stored. | Implementing a **dictionary** or **map** for fast lookups based on a key (e.g., employee ID → name). | **Average Case (Insertion/Search/Deletion):** $O(1)$ |\n\n---\n\n### **Key Concepts Explained**\n\n* **Time Complexity:** This refers to how the time taken by an algorithm to run grows as the input size (n) grows.\n* **Array Caveat:** While array access is $O(1)$, insertion or deletion in the middle is $O(n)$.\n* **Linked List Caveat:** Searching for a specific element is $O(n)$.\n* **Hash Table Caveat:** $O(1)$ average case, but $O(n)$ in the worst case due to collisions.",

Provides flexible memory allocation. | `struct Node { int data; struct Node *next; };` | Access: O(n), Search: O(n), Insert: O(1), Delete: O(1) |\n| **Stack** | A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end (top).
