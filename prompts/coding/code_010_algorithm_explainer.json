    "gemini-2.5": "Hello class! 👋 That's a great piece of code to analyze. It's a simple program, but it demonstrates the **fundamental steps of computation**: input, processing, and output.\n\nHere is the algorithm for that Python code, broken down into simple, easy-to-follow steps:\n\n---\n\n## 💻 Algorithm: Calculating the Sum of Two Numbers\n\nThis algorithm explains what the computer does when it runs the provided code:\n\n1.  **Start the Program:** The computer begins executing the instructions.\n2.  **Store the First Number:** A space in the computer's memory is reserved and given the name **`num1`**. The value **10** is placed into this space.\n    * *Analogy: Think of labeling a box \"num1\" and putting the number 10 inside it.*\n3.  **Store the Second Number:** Another space in memory is reserved and named **`num2`**. The value **5** is placed into this second space.\n4.  **Calculate the Sum:** The computer performs the **addition** operation. It takes the value from `num1` (which is 10) and adds it to the value from `num2` (which is 5).\n5.  **Store the Result:** The result of the calculation (10 + 5 = 15) is stored in a new memory space named **`sum`**.\n6.  **Display the Message:** The program prepares to show the result to the user. It constructs the full message: **\"The sum is: 15\"**.\n7.  **Output the Message:** This final message is shown on the computer screen.\n8.  **End the Program:** The program finishes executing.\n\n---\n\nThis is essentially how a computer takes **input** (the numbers), **processes** the data (the addition), and generates **output** (the printed result).\n\nWould you like to try writing a simple Python program based on another algorithm, perhaps one that calculates the difference between two numbers?",
    "claude-3": "# Python Code Algorithm\n\nHere's what this code does, step by step:\n\n**Step 1:** Create a variable called `num1` and store the value `10` in it.\n\n**Step 2:** Create a variable called `num2` and store the value `5` in it.\n\n**Step 3:** Add the two numbers together (`10 + 5`) and store the result in a new variable called `sum`. The result is `15`.\n\n**Step 4:** Display a message on the screen that says \"The sum is: 15\" by printing the text along with the value stored in the `sum` variable.\n\n---\n\n## In Even Simpler Terms:\n\nThink of variables as labeled boxes. We put the number 10 in one box and 5 in another. Then we add what's in both boxes together and put the result (15) in a new box. Finally, we show someone the message along with what's in that final box."
