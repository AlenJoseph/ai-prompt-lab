    "gpt-5": "Here’s a clear **side-by-side comparison** between **for loop** and **while loop** in **Python** 👇\n\n| Feature | **For Loop** | **While Loop** |\n|----------|---------------|----------------|\n| **Definition** | A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range). | A `while` loop repeats a block of code **as long as a condition is true**. |\n| **Purpose** | Used when the **number of iterations is known** or when iterating through a sequence. | Used when the **number of iterations is unknown** and depends on a condition. |\n| **How It Works** | Automatically takes each item from a sequence (or uses a range) and executes the block for each item. | Keeps executing the block **until the condition becomes False**. The condition is checked **before each iteration**. |\n| **Syntax** | ```python\\nfor variable in sequence:\\n    # code block``` | ```python\\nwhile condition:\\n    # code block``` |\n| **Control Variable** | The control variable (iterator) is **automatically updated** in each iteration. | You must **manually update** the variable used in the condition, otherwise it may cause an **infinite loop**. |\n| **Typical Use Cases** | Iterating over lists, strings, ranges, or dictionaries. | Running loops until a specific condition is met (e.g., user input, sensor value, etc.). |\n| **Example** | ```python\\n# Using for loop\\nfor i in range(5):\\n    print(i)```\\n**Output:**\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4 | ```python\\n# Using while loop\\ni = 0\\nwhile i < 5:\\n    print(i)\\n    i += 1```\\n**Output:**\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4 |\n| **When to Use** | When you know how many times you want to loop or are looping through a fixed collection. | When you don’t know how many times to loop in advance and rely on a condition becoming false. |\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Quick Summary:\n- Use a **for loop** when you need to **iterate over a sequence** or **fixed range**.\n- Use a **while loop** when you need to **repeat until a condition changes**.",
    
    "gemini-2.5": "Both **for** loops and **while** loops in Python are used for **iteration** (repeating a block of code), but they differ primarily in **how** they control repetition.\n\nA **for** loop is typically used when you know the **number of iterations** beforehand or want to iterate over a **sequence** (like a list, tuple, or string). A **while** loop is used when the number of iterations is **unknown** and the loop needs to continue until a specific **condition becomes false**.\n\n## 💻 For Loop vs. While Loop in Python: Side-by-Side Comparison\n\n| Feature | For Loop | While Loop |\n|:---|:---|:---|\n| **Definition** | A control flow statement that **iterates over a sequence** (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or **other iterable objects**. | A control flow statement that **executes a block of code repeatedly** as long as a specified **condition is true**. |\n| **Purpose** | Used when you need to **iterate a fixed number of times** or over the **elements of an iterable object**. | Used when you need to **repeat a block of code until a condition is met**, and the number of repetitions is **not known beforehand**. |\n| **How it Works** | Iterates through each **item** in the sequence, executing the block once for each item. The loop **automatically terminates** when the sequence is exhausted. | Checks the condition **before** each iteration. If the condition is **True**, the code block executes. The loop continues until the condition becomes **False** (or a `break` is encountered). |\n| **Common Use Case** | Processing items in a list, performing a task N times. | Reading data until an end-of-file marker is reached, repeating a menu until a valid option is chosen. |\n| **Initialization** | The loop **variable is implicitly initialized** as part of the loop structure and assigned values from the iterable. | The loop **control variable often needs to be initialized before** the loop starts, and **updated inside** the loop to avoid an infinite loop. |\n| **Syntax** | ```python\\nfor item in sequence:\\n    # code to execute``` | ```python\\nwhile condition:\\n    # code to execute\\n    # optional: update variable``` |\n| **Example** | ```python\\nfor i in range(3):\\n    print(i)\\n# Output: 0, 1, 2``` | ```python\\ncount = 0\\nwhile count < 3:\\n    print(count)\\n    count += 1\\n# Output: 0, 1, 2``` |",
    
    "claude-3": "Here’s a clear comparison table showing the key differences between **for loops** and **while loops** in Python.\n\n| Aspect | For Loop | While Loop |\n|:---|:---|:---|\n| **Definition** | A loop that iterates over a sequence (list, tuple, string, range) a fixed number of times, executing a block of code for each item. | A loop that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true, continuing until the condition becomes false. |\n| **Purpose** | Best used when you know exactly how many times you need to iterate (iterating through a collection or a range). | Best used when you need to repeat something until a condition is met, but you don't know exactly how many iterations are needed. |\n| **How It Works** | Automatically iterates through each element in a sequence, incrementing through the collection until all items are processed. | Checks if a condition is true before each iteration.
