    "gpt-5": "Sure! Let’s break it down in simple terms.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Time Complexity\n\nTime complexity measures **how much time an algorithm takes to run** as the size of the input grows.\n\n- It focuses on the **number of steps or operations** an algorithm performs.\n- Usually expressed using **Big O notation**, e.g., `O(1)`, `O(n)`, `O(n^2)`.\n- Helps predict how the program will scale with large inputs.\n\n**Example:**\n```python\n# Example: Finding a number in a list\ndef find_number(arr, target):\n    for num in arr:  # Loop runs n times\n        if num == target:\n            return True\n    return False\n```\n- If `arr` has `n` elements, the worst-case time complexity is **O(n)** because it may check each element once.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Space Complexity\n\nSpace complexity measures **how much memory an algorithm uses** as the size of the input grows.\n\n- It includes memory for variables, data structures, function calls, etc.\n- Also expressed using **Big O notation**, e.g., `O(1)`, `O(n)`.\n- Helps estimate the memory requirement for the program.\n\n**Example:**\n```python\n# Example: Storing numbers in a new list\ndef square_numbers(arr):\n    squared = []  # Extra memory for n elements\n    for num in arr:\n        squared.append(num**2)\n    return squared\n```\n- If `arr` has `n` elements, space complexity is **O(n)** because a new list of `n` elements is created.\n\n---\n\n### Key Difference\n\n| Feature               | Time Complexity                    | Space Complexity                           |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **Definition**        | Measures the time taken to execute | Measures the memory used during execution  |\n| **Focus**             | Number of operations               | Amount of memory allocated                 |\n| **Notation**          | Big O (e.g., O(1), O(n), O(n^2))  | Big O (e.g., O(1), O(n))                   |\n| **Example**           | Looping through a list (O(n))      | Creating a new list to store values (O(n)) |\n| **Optimization Goal** | Reduce execution time              | Reduce memory usage                        |",
