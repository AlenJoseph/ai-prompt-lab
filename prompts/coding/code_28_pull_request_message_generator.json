    "gpt-5": "Here’s a **well-structured Pull Request (PR)** message example you can use when submitting your code for adding a **login feature** on GitHub:\n\n---\n\n### 🧩 **Title**\n**feat: Add user login feature with authentication and validation**\n\n---\n\n### 📝 **Description**\nThis PR implements the user login functionality, allowing registered users to securely authenticate and access their accounts. It includes both frontend and backend changes to support form validation, API integration, and session handling.\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 **Changes Made**\n- **Frontend:**\n  - Added `Login.jsx` component with form fields for email and password\n  - Implemented form validation and error handling\n  - Integrated login API call using Axios\n  - Updated routes to redirect authenticated users to the dashboard\n- **Backend:**\n  - Added `/api/auth/login` endpoint\n  - Implemented JWT-based authentication\n  - Added password hashing and verification using bcrypt\n  - Added middleware for token validation\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 **How It Works**\n1. User enters credentials in the login form.\n2. Credentials are sent to the backend API.\n3. The API verifies user data, generates a JWT, and returns it to the frontend.\n4. Token is stored in localStorage/sessionStorage for maintaining sessions.\n5. Authenticated users are redirected to their dashboard.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Testing Steps**\n1. Run `npm start` (frontend) and `npm run dev` (backend).\n2. Navigate to `/login` page.\n3. Enter a valid registered email and password → expect redirection to dashboard.\n4. Enter invalid credentials → expect error message display.\n5. Inspect localStorage → verify token is stored after successful login.\n\n---\n\n### 🧪 **Test Coverage**\n- Unit tests for login form validation.\n- Integration tests for `/api/auth/login` endpoint.\n- Manual UI testing for error messages and redirections.\n\n---\n\n### 📷 **Screenshots (if applicable)**\n*(Attach screenshots showing the login page UI and success/error states)*\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ **Related Issues**\nCloses #45 — *Implement login feature*\n(Related to #30 — *User authentication system setup*)\n\n---\n\n### 🧾 **Notes for Reviewers**\n- Please verify token expiration handling.\n- Feedback on UI/UX of the login form is appreciated.\n- Ensure compatibility with the existing signup flow.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to tailor this PR message for a **specific stack** (e.g., React + Flask, MERN, or Node + Express)? I can adapt it with more realistic details for your exact tech setup.",
    "gemini-2.5": "Pull Request: Feature - User Login Implementation\n\nTitle: feat: Implement basic user authentication and login feature\n\n🚀 Summary\n\nThis PR introduces the complete user login functionality required for authenticated access to the application. It includes new UI components for the login form, implements the authentication service to handle credentials, and integrates state management to track the user's session.\n\nThis feature is built upon the existing component structure and uses [Specify Auth Library/Framework, e.g., Firebase Auth, JWT, OAuth] for secure token handling.\n\n🔗 Related Issue\n\nCloses: #123 (Feat: Develop user login page and service)\n\n📋 Key Changes\n\n- **New Component:** Added LoginComponent (`src/components/LoginComponent.js`) which handles form input validation and submission.\n- **Service Layer:** Created AuthService (`src/services/authService.js`) with methods for `loginUser(email, password)` and `logoutUser()`.\n- **State Management:** Integrated user state into [Specify State Manager, e.g., Redux/Context/Pinia] to store the authToken and currentUser object.\n- **Routing:** Configured protected routes (`/dashboard`) to redirect unauthorized users to the `/login` page.\n- **Dependencies:** Installed and configured [e.g., react-hook-form for validation].\n\n✅ **Testing Instructions**\n\nReviewers, please follow these steps to verify the feature:\n\n1. Navigate: Start the application and go to the `/login` route.\n2. **Success Case:** Enter valid credentials (e.g., `test@example.com` / `password123`) and click \"Log In.\" You should be redirected to the `/dashboard` page, and the navigation bar should display the user's name/profile.\n3. **Failure Case:** Enter invalid credentials. An error message (e.g., \"Invalid email or password\") should display below the form without refreshing the page.\n4. **Logout:** Verify that clicking the \"Logout\" button destroys the session and redirects you back to the `/login` page.\n\n🖼️ **Screenshots/Videos**\n\n[NOTE: Replace this line with a GIF or a screenshot showing the successful login and redirection. This significantly speeds up the review process!]\n\n📝 **Review Checklist**\n\n- [x] Code follows project style guidelines.\n- [x] Unit tests for AuthService have been added/updated.\n- [ ] All new functionality is fully documented (if applicable).\n- [x] UI is responsive and works correctly on mobile viewports.\n- [x] Error states (bad credentials, network failure) are handled gracefully.\n\n**Future Scope:** This PR does not include the \"Forgot Password\" or \"Sign Up\" flows, which will be addressed in subsequent PRs (#124 and #125).",
    "claude-3": "# Pull Request: Add User Login Feature\n\n## Description\nThis PR implements a complete user authentication system that allows users to securely log into the application with email and password credentials. The login feature includes input validation, error handling, and session management.\n\n## Type of Change\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\n- [ ] Documentation update\n\n## What Changed\n- Added `LoginController` to handle authentication logic\n- Created `LoginView` component with email and password input fields\n- Implemented JWT-based session token generation and storage\n- Added `AuthService` for credential validation and user lookup\n- Created middleware for protecting authenticated routes\n- Added comprehensive error handling for invalid credentials\n\n## Why This Change\nUsers previously had no way to access personalized features or protect their data. This login system enables secure user identification and allows us to build personalized user experiences and secure endpoints.\n\n## How to Test\n1. Navigate to `/login` in your browser.\n2. Test with valid credentials:\n   - Email: `demo@example.com`\n   - Password: `password123`\n3. Verify successful login redirects to dashboard.\n4. Test invalid credentials and confirm error message displays.\n5. Check that session token is stored in local storage.\n6. Verify protected routes redirect to login when not authenticated.\n7. Test logout clears session and redirects to home page.\n\n## Related Issues\nCloses #45\nRelated to #32, #67\n\n## Checklist\n- [x] My code follows the style guidelines of this project\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\n- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\n- [x] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix/feature works\n- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes\n- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged and published\n\n## Screenshots (if applicable)\n- Login page with email/password fields\n- Success message after login\n- Error message for invalid credentials\n\n## Files Changed\n- `src/controllers/LoginController.js` - New\n- `src/services/AuthService.js` - New\n- `src/middleware/authMiddleware.js` - New\n- `src/views/LoginView.jsx` - New\n- `src/routes/index.js` - Modified\n- `tests/LoginController.test.js` - New\n- `tests/AuthService.test.js` - New\n\n## Additional Notes\n- Session tokens expire after 24 hours\n- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage\n- No breaking changes to existing functionality\n- Ready for code review\n\n---\n**Reviewer Notes:** Please verify authentication flow and security implementations, especially password hashing and token generation."
