    "gpt-5": "### 🧠 **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n\n**Definition:**\n**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm (or style) that organizes software design around **objects**, which are instances of **classes**. Each object represents a real-world entity and contains **data (attributes)** and **behavior (methods)** that operate on that data.\n\nIn simple terms — OOP helps you **model real-life things (like a car, bank account, or student)** in your program using **objects**.\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 **Purpose of OOP**\n\nThe main goals of Object-Oriented Programming are to:\n\n1. **Increase Reusability:** Write once, reuse many times using classes and inheritance.\n2. **Improve Maintainability:** Code is modular and easy to update.\n3. **Enhance Readability:** Code structure mimics real-world relationships.\n4. **Support Scalability:** Suitable for large and complex software systems.\n5. **Encapsulate Data:** Protects data from unintended interference by bundling it inside objects.\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ **Key Concepts of OOP**\n\n| Concept | Description | Example |\n|----------|--------------|----------|\n| **Class** | A blueprint or template for creating objects. | `class Car { ... }` |\n| **Object** | An instance of a class. | `myCar = new Car()` |\n| **Encapsulation** | Hiding internal details and exposing only necessary parts. | Private variables with getters/setters |\n| **Inheritance** | Reusing code by creating new classes from existing ones. | `class ElectricCar extends Car` |\n| **Polymorphism** | Same method name behaves differently in different classes. | `car.start()` works differently for `ElectricCar` and `DieselCar` |\n| **Abstraction** | Showing only essential features, hiding complex details. | `startEngine()` hides how the engine starts internally |\n\n---\n\n### 💻 **Example (in Python)**\n\n```python\n# Define a class (blueprint)\nclass Car:\n    def __init__(self, brand, model):\n        self.brand = brand  # Attribute\n        self.model = model\n\n    def start_engine(self):  # Method\n        print(f\"{self.brand} {self.model} engine started!\")\n\n# Create objects (instances)\ncar1 = Car(\"Tesla\", \"Model S\")\ncar2 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n\n# Use methods\ncar1.start_engine()\ncar2.start_engine()\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nTesla Model S engine started!\nToyota Corolla engine started!\n```\n\nHere:\n- `Car` is a **class**.\n- `car1` and `car2` are **objects**.\n- `start_engine()` is a **method** that defines behavior.\n\n---\n\n### 🌍 **Real-World Applications of OOP**\n\n| Domain | Example | How OOP Helps |\n|--------|----------|---------------|\n| **Banking Systems** | Classes like `Account`, `Customer`, `Transaction` | Keeps data secure and organized |\n| **Game Development** | Classes like `Player`, `Enemy`, `Weapon` | Models real-world entities with behavior |\n| **Web Development** | Classes like `User`, `Product`, `Order` | Reusable and scalable code structure |\n| **GUI Applications** | Buttons, Windows, Menus as objects | Easy to manage and extend interfaces |\n| **Simulation Software** | Cars, planes, or people as objects | Simulates real-world behavior |\n\n---\n\n### 🧩 **In Summary**\n\n- **OOP = Organize code as objects that represent real-world things.**\n- **Main ideas:** Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.\n- **Benefits:** Modular, reusable, scalable, and easier to maintain.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to show a **visual diagram** of how classes and objects relate (like a “blueprint → object” chart)?",
    
    "gemini-2.5": "## 💻 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Explained\n\nObject-Oriented Programming (**OOP**) is a **programming paradigm** (a style of programming) that organizes software design around **data**, or **objects**, rather than functions and logic. It structures a program into self-contained units (objects) that combine both **data** (attributes) and **behavior** (methods).\n\n---\n\n### 📝 Definition\n\nOOP is a method of developing software where a program is modeled as a collection of interacting **objects**, each instance of a **class**.\n\n- **Class:** A **blueprint** or a template for creating objects. It defines the common properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that all objects of a certain type will possess.\n- **Object:** An **instance** of a class. It is a real-world entity that has a state (the values of its attributes) and behavior (its methods).\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 Purpose\n\nThe primary goal of OOP is to manage the complexity of large software applications by making the code more **modular**, **reusable**, and **maintainable**.\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n- **Modularity:** Breaking down a complex problem into smaller, self-contained objects makes the system easier to understand, design, and debug.\n- **Reusability (via Inheritance):** Allows new classes to be created by inheriting properties and methods from existing classes, reducing redundant code.\n- **Maintainability and Scalability:** Changes or updates in one part of the system (within an object) are less likely to affect other parts.\n- **Data Security (via Encapsulation):** Internal data is hidden and protected from unauthorized access or modification.\n\n---\n\n### 💡 Example and Core Concepts\n\n| OOP Concept | Description | Example (A `Car` Class) |\n|--------------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| **Encapsulation** | Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into one unit (the object). | The `Car` object contains data like `color`, `speed`, and methods like `accelerate()`. |\n| **Abstraction** | Showing only essential information and hiding the complex implementation. | When you press `accelerate()`, you don't see the engine mechanics. |\n| **Inheritance** | Creating new classes from existing ones. | `SportsCar` inherits from `Car` and adds `activateTurbo()`. |\n| **Polymorphism** | Same method name, different behaviors. | `startEngine()` works differently for `GasCar` and `ElectricCar`. |\n\n---\n\n### 🌐 Real-World Applications\n\n- **Software Frameworks:** Django, Spring, and Ruby on Rails are built using OOP principles.\n- **Game Development:** Characters, weapons, and levels are modeled as objects.\n- **GUI Systems:** Buttons, windows, and menus are object-based components.\n- **Databases:** Object-oriented databases store information as objects.\n- **Operating Systems:** Core modules use OOP for modular design.\n\nWould you like to see a **code example of inheritance** in Python or Java?",
    
    "claude-3": "# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n\n**Definition**\n\nObject-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes code around **objects** rather than functions and logic. An object is a self-contained unit combining **data (attributes)** and **functions (methods)**. OOP uses **classes** as blueprints for creating objects, helping programmers represent real-world entities and their interactions.\n\n**Purpose**\n\nOOP aims to make code more **modular**, **reusable**, and **maintainable**. By bundling related data and behavior, OOP reduces complexity and improves structure. It supports principles like **inheritance** (reusing code), **polymorphism** (different responses to the same message), and **encapsulation** (hiding internal details). These lead to cleaner architecture, fewer bugs, and easier scalability.\n\n**Example (Python)**\n\n```python\nclass Dog:\n    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n        self.name = name\n        self.breed = breed\n    \n    def bark(self):\n        return f\"{self.name} says Woof!\"\n    \n    def fetch(self):\n        return f\"{self.name} is fetching the ball!\"\n\n# Creating an object\nmy_dog = Dog(\"Max\", \"Golden Retriever\")\nprint(my_dog.bark())        # Output: Max says Woof!\nprint(my_dog.fetch())       # Output: Max is fetching the ball!\n```\n\nHere, `Dog` is the **class**, and `my_dog` is an **object**. It has attributes (`name`, `breed`) and methods (`bark()`, `fetch()`).\n\n**Real-World Applications**\n\nOOP underpins most modern software systems:\n- **Game Development:** Represent players, enemies, and weapons as objects.\n- **Web Development:** Frameworks like Django and Spring structure applications using OOP.\n- **Banking Systems:** Model accounts, customers, and transactions as objects.\n- **E-commerce Platforms:** Represent products, orders, and customers as objects.\n- **Mobile Apps:** Manage UI components and user interactions through objects.\n- **Operating Systems:** Use OOP principles for modular, stable design.\n\nOOP’s ability to model real-world entities makes it one of the most widely used and powerful programming paradigms today."
