    "gpt-5": "Here’s your Python code rewritten with **clear, beginner-friendly comments** that explain each line step by step 👇\n\n```python\n# This function is used to greet a person by their name\ndef greet(name):\n    # Create a greeting message by joining the word 'Hello,' with the given name\n    message = 'Hello, ' + name + '!'\n    \n    # Print the greeting message on the screen\n    print(message)\n\n# Call the greet() function and pass the name 'Alice'\n# This will display 'Hello, Alice!' on the screen\ngreet('Alice')\n```\n\n✅ **Explanation:**\n\n* The `def` keyword is used to define a function in Python.\n* `'Hello, ' + name + '!'` joins text and the given name into one complete message.\n* `print(message)` displays the result in the console.\n* The last line actually *runs* the function, greeting 'Alice.'",
    "gemini-2.5": "That's a great simple function! Adding clear and descriptive comments is a crucial skill for any programmer. Here is the Python code with comments that are easy for everyone to understand:\n\n```python\n# Define a function named 'greet' that takes one argument: 'name'\n# This function is designed to create a personalized greeting.\ndef greet(name):\n    # Create a string variable named 'message'.\n    # It combines the fixed text 'Hello, ' with the value passed in for 'name',\n    # and adds an exclamation mark at the end.\n    message = 'Hello, ' + name + '!'\n\n    # Display the final 'message' to the user on the console (screen).\n    print(message)\n\n# --- Function Call ---\n\n# Call the 'greet' function and pass the string 'Alice' as the value for the 'name' argument.\n# This will cause the function to run and print 'Hello, Alice!'\ngreet('Alice')\n```\n\n-----\n\n### 📝 Key Takeaways on Comments\n\n* **Explain the 'Why':** Good comments explain the *purpose* of the code block, not just what the code *literally* does (which the code itself shows).\n* **Focus on Logic:** Comments should highlight important steps or non-obvious logic.\n* **Keep it Simple:** Since you're teaching beginners, I used simple, everyday language.\n\nWould you like to try commenting on another small function, or perhaps would you like a quick tip on the different *types* of comments in Python (like docstrings)?",
    "claude-3": "I'll add clear comments to make this code easy to understand. I've added comments that explain:\n\n1. **Function definition** - what the function does and what parameter it needs\n2. **Message creation** - how the string is built by combining parts together\n3. **Print statement** - what happens when we use `print()`\n4. **Function call** - how we actually use the function with a specific name\n\nThese comments use simple language so anyone learning Python can follow what each line does!\n\n```python\n# Define a function called 'greet' that takes one parameter: a person's name\ndef greet(name):\n    # Create a message by combining 'Hello, ' with the name and an exclamation mark\n    message = 'Hello, ' + name + '!'\n    # Display the message on the screen\n    print(message)\n\n# Call the greet function and pass 'Alice' as the name\ngreet('Alice')\n```"
