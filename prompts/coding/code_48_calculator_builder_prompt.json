    "gpt-5": "Got it! You want a prompt that, when used in an AI (like me), will generate Python code for a calculator. Let’s make it clear, structured, and beginner-friendly but also flexible enough for extensions. Here's an example prompt you could use:\n\n---\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n```\nYou are an expert Python programmer. Write a Python program that functions as a calculator. The calculator should:\n\n1. Allow the user to perform basic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/).\n2. Ask the user to input two numbers and the operation they want to perform.\n3. Handle invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., letters instead of numbers, division by zero).\n4. Show the result clearly.\n5. Optionally, allow the user to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.\n6. Include comments explaining each part of the code.\n\nMake the code beginner-friendly, using clear variable names and readable formatting.\n```\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also **write a full ready-to-run Python calculator program** based on this prompt. Do you want me to do that?",
    "gemini-2.5": "That's a great idea! Here is a prompt you can use to build a **basic command-line calculator** in Python.\n\n## 📝 Calculator Prompt\n\n**Goal:** Create a complete, working Python script for a simple command-line calculator that can perform four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n### Key Requirements\n\n1. **Functions:** Define separate functions for each operation: `add(a, b)`, `subtract(a, b)`, `multiply(a, b)`, and `divide(a, b)`.\n2. **User Interface (UI):**\n   - The program must present the user with a menu of operations (e.g., \"1. Add\", \"2. Subtract\", etc.).\n   - The user should be prompted to select an operation.\n   - The user should then be prompted to enter **two numbers**.\n3. **Input Handling:** Ensure the inputs are correctly converted to a numerical type (like `float`) to handle decimals.\n4. **Division Error Handling:** Include error handling (using a `try...except` block) specifically to prevent the program from crashing if the user attempts to **divide by zero**.\n5. **Output:** Display the result of the calculation clearly.\n6. **Looping:** The calculator should run in a **loop**, allowing the user to perform multiple calculations until they explicitly choose to exit. Include an option to exit the program (e.g., \"5. Exit\").\n\n### Example Output Flow\n\n```\nPlease select an operation:\n1. Add\n2. Subtract\n3. Multiply\n4. Divide\n5. Exit\n\nEnter choice (1/2/3/4/5): 3\nEnter first number: 10\nEnter second number: 5\n10.0 * 5.0 = 50.0\n\n... (loop continues) ...\n\nEnter choice (1/2/3/4/5): 5\nExiting calculator.\n```\n\n**Would you like me to generate the Python code based on this prompt now?**",
    "claude-3": "Here's a well-structured prompt you can use to get Claude to build a calculator in Python:\n\n---\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"Create a Python calculator program that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The calculator should:\n\n1. Accept user input for two numbers and an operator.\n2. Display the result of the calculation.\n3. Handle division by zero with an appropriate error message.\n4. Allow the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.\n5. Include a clear way for the user to exit the program.\n\nMake the code clean, well-commented, and easy to understand. Include input validation to ensure the user enters valid numbers and supported operators.\"\n\n---\n\n**Tips for prompt engineering:**\n\n- **Be specific**: Instead of just \"make a calculator,\" specify which operations you want and what features matter to you.\n- **Define behavior**: Explain how the program should handle edge cases (like division by zero).\n- **Mention constraints**: If you want specific code style, length, or structure, say so.\n- **Iterate**: If the first result doesn't match your needs, give feedback like \"Make it more interactive\" or \"Add more features.\"\n\nIf you want something more advanced, you could extend the prompt to request features like:\n- Support for more operations (exponents, square root, modulo)\n- A GUI using tkinter or PyQt\n- History of previous calculations\n- Scientific calculator functions\n\nWould you like help refining this prompt further, or do you want me to show you what a response to this prompt might look like?"
