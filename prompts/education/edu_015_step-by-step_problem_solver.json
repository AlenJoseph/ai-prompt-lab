    "gpt-5": "# Solution — uniformly accelerated motion\n\n**Given:** a car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at a = 2.0 m/s^2 for a time t = 8.0 s.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Knowns and unknowns\n\n**Known**\n\n- Initial speed: u = 0 m/s (starts from rest)\n- Acceleration: a = 2.0 m/s^2\n- Time: t = 8.0 s\n\n**Unknown**\n\n- (a) Final speed v after 8.0 s\n- (b) Distance travelled s in those 8.0 s\n\n---\n\n## 2) Formulas to use\n\n(a) Final speed (uniform acceleration):\n\nv = u + a t\n\n(b) Displacement under constant acceleration:\n\ns = u t + (1/2) a t^2\n\n---\n\n## 3) Step-by-step calculations\n\n### (a) Final speed\n\nStart with v = u + a t.\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\nv = 0 + (2.0 m/s^2)(8.0 s).\n\nCompute multiplication (digit-by-digit):\n\n8.0 × 2.0 = 16.0.\n\nSo\n\nv = 16.0 m/s.\n\n### (b) Distance travelled\n\nStart with s = u t + (1/2) a t^2.\n\nSince u = 0, the first term is zero. So\n\ns = (1/2) a t^2.\n\nCompute t^2 first: 8.0 × 8.0 = 64.0.\n\nCompute (1/2) a: (1/2) × 2.0 = 1.0.\n\nNow multiply: 1.0 × 64.0 = 64.0.\n\nSo\n\ns = 64.0 m.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Final answers\n\n- (a) Final speed v = 16.0 m/s.\n- (b) Distance travelled s = 64.0 m.\n\nIf you want, I can convert v to km/h or add a velocity–time graph for intuition.",
    "gemini-2.5": "Hello! I'd be happy to help you solve this physics problem step-by-step. This problem involves uniformly accelerated motion, which can be solved using the kinematic equations.\n\n## Kinematics Problem Solution\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution to find the final speed and the distance traveled.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Identify Knowns and Unknowns\n\nFirst, let's list the information given in the problem and what we need to find.\n\n| Quantity | Symbol | Value | Type |\n|---|---:|---:|---|\n| Initial Speed | v0 | 0.0 m/s | Known (starts from rest) |\n| Acceleration | a | 2.0 m/s^2 | Known |\n| Time | t | 8.0 s | Known |\n| Final Speed | v | ? | Unknown (a) |\n| Distance Traveled | x | ? | Unknown (b) |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Solve for (a) Final Speed (v)\n\nFormula to use:\n\nv = v0 + a t\n\nSubstitute values:\n\nv = 0.0 + (2.0)(8.0) = 16.0 m/s\n\n### 3. Solve for (b) Distance Traveled (x)\n\nFormula to use:\n\nx = v0 t + (1/2) a t^2\n\nSubstitute values (v0 = 0):\n\nx = 0 + (1/2)(2.0)(8.0)^2 = 1.0 × 64.0 = 64.0 m\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- (a) Final Speed v = 16.0 m/s\n- (b) Distance Traveled x = 64.0 m\n\nWould you like a similar practice problem or a quick check with a velocity–time graph?",
