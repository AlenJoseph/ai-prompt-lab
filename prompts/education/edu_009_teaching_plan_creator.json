    "gpt-5": "Here’s a detailed teaching plan for **Grade 3 students** on the topic **“Water Cycle”**:\n\n---\n\n## **Teaching Plan: Water Cycle (Grade 3)**\n\n### **Learning Objectives**\nBy the end of the lesson, students should be able to:\n1. Understand what the water cycle is and why it is important.\n2. Identify and describe the main stages of the water cycle: **evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection**.\n3. Explain how water moves from the Earth to the atmosphere and back.\n4. Demonstrate understanding through drawings, activities, and simple explanations.\n\n### **Teaching Strategies**\n1. **Visual Learning**: Use diagrams, animations, and videos to illustrate the water cycle stages.\n2. **Storytelling & Analogies**: Explain the cycle using relatable examples (e.g., boiling water as evaporation, clouds forming as condensation).\n3. **Hands-on Activities**: Simple experiments like making a mini water cycle in a bag.\n4. **Interactive Discussion**: Ask questions to involve students and connect the topic to daily life (e.g., rain, puddles, rivers).\n5. **Reinforcement with Games**: Use quizzes, flashcards, and matching activities to reinforce learning.\n\n### **Classroom Activities**\n1. **Introduction (10 minutes)**\n   * Show a short animated video of the water cycle.\n   * Ask students questions: “Where does rain come from?” “What happens to puddles after the sun shines?”\n\n2. **Explaining the Stages (15 minutes)**\n   * Use a large diagram to explain **evaporation → condensation → precipitation → collection**.\n   * Give real-life examples for each stage:\n     * Evaporation: puddles drying\n     * Condensation: water droplets on a cold glass\n     * Precipitation: rain, snow\n     * Collection: rivers, lakes, oceans\n\n3. **Hands-on Activity: Mini Water Cycle (20 minutes)**\n   * Materials: Clear plastic bag, water, blue food coloring, tape, sunlight.\n   * Steps:\n     1. Pour a small amount of water into the bag.\n     2. Add a drop of blue food coloring (optional).\n     3. Seal the bag and tape it to a sunny window.\n     4. Observe evaporation, condensation, and “rain” forming inside the bag over time.\n\n4. **Drawing & Labeling Activity (15 minutes)**\n   * Students draw their own water cycle diagram and label the stages.\n   * Encourage creativity with colors and illustrations.\n\n5. **Discussion & Recap (10 minutes)**\n   * Ask students to explain the water cycle in their own words.\n   * Use flashcards to match terms with definitions.\n\n### **Homework**\n1. **Worksheet**: Fill in the blanks, match stages with pictures, and label a water cycle diagram.\n2. **Observation Task**: Look outside for examples of the water cycle (rain, puddles drying, morning dew) and write 2-3 sentences about it.\n3. **Creative Task**: Draw a comic strip showing the journey of a water droplet through the water cycle.\n\n### **Assessment**\n* Participation in class discussion and activities.\n* Accuracy of drawings and labels in classroom work and homework.\n* Ability to explain the stages in simple terms.",
    
    "gemini-2.5": "Grade 3 Lesson Plan: The Water Cycle\n\nTopic: The Water Cycle (Hydrologic Cycle)\n\nTarget Grade Level: Grade 3 (Ages 8-9)\n\nEstimated Time: 90 minutes (can be broken into two 45-minute sessions)\n\n1. Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n- Identify and sequence the four main stages of the water cycle: Evaporation, Condensation, Precipitation, and Collection.\n- Define key vocabulary associated with the water cycle (e.g., water vapor, liquid, solid).\n- Explain that the water cycle is continuous with no true start or end.\n- Connect the water cycle to daily life, including weather and water sources.\n\n2. Essential Vocabulary\n- Water Cycle: Continuous journey of water around the Earth.\n- Evaporation: When the sun heats liquid water, turning it into invisible gas (water vapor).\n- Condensation: When water vapor cools and forms tiny liquid droplets (clouds).\n- Precipitation: Water falling from clouds as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n- Collection: Water gathering in rivers, lakes, oceans, or underground.\n- Water Vapor: Water in its invisible gas form.\n\n3. Materials\n- Large poster or whiteboard\n- Markers/Crayons\n- Clear Ziploc bags\n- Water and blue food coloring (optional)\n- Tape\n- Story/video about the water cycle\n- Worksheets\n\n4. Teaching Strategies & Lesson Procedure\n- **Engage (15 min)**: K-W-L chart, brainstorming, hook question about rain and water disappearance.\n- **Explore (20 min)**: Baggy cycle experiment with Ziploc bags and water; prediction discussion.\n- **Explain (30 min)**: Story/video about water cycle; diagramming stages; review baggy experiment.\n- **Elaborate (20 min)**: Water cycle dance/action game with assigned roles for each stage.\n- **Evaluate (5 min)**: Exit ticket drawing of four stages connected in a circle.\n\n5. Homework Assignment: 'My Water Drop Adventure'\n- Draw the water cycle.\n- Label stages: Evaporation, Condensation, Precipitation, Collection.\n- Write a short story from a water drop's perspective (3-5 sentences).\n- Optional: Research another water-related term like 'aquifer' or 'runoff'.",
    
    "claude-3": "# Grade 3 Water Cycle Teaching Plan\n\n## Overview\nTwo-week unit introducing third-grade students to the water cycle (evaporation, condensation, precipitation, collection).
