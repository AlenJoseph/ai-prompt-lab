  "prompt": "Follow the examples below to create dialogues to understand the concept {science_concept}. Example 1: Teacher: Why do we see lightning before hearing thunder? Student: Because light travels faster than sound! Teacher: Perfect. So lightning and thunder happen together, but we see one first. Example 2: Teacher: What happens when we light a candle? Student: It burns and gives light. Teacher: Right! Do you know what that burning process is called? Student: Umm... burning? Teacher: Yes, but scientifically it’s called combustion — when something reacts with oxygen and gives off heat and light. Now, create 8 dialogues for the concept: {science_concept}.",

    "gpt-5": "Here’s a set of 8 dialogues to explain the concept of **mutation** in a student-friendly way:\n\n---\n\n**Dialogue 1**\nTeacher: Do you know why children sometimes look a little different from their parents?\nStudent: Because they inherit traits from both parents?\nTeacher: Yes! And sometimes, small changes in genes can occur — these changes are called **mutations**.\n\n---\n\n**Dialogue 2**\nTeacher: If a plant suddenly has a new color of flower, what do you think caused it?\nStudent: Maybe it’s a new type of plant?\nTeacher: Not exactly. That change can happen due to a **mutation** in the plant’s genes.\n\n---\n\n**Dialogue 3**\nTeacher: Why do some animals have spots or stripes that others of their species don’t?\nStudent: Because of differences in their parents?\nTeacher: Correct, and sometimes **mutations** create these differences, giving them unique patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Dialogue 4**\nTeacher: What happens when a gene changes its sequence?\nStudent: Umm… the organism might be different?\nTeacher: Exactly! That change is called a **mutation**, and it can affect how the organism looks or functions.\n\n---\n\n**Dialogue 5**\nTeacher: Can mutations be harmful?\nStudent: Maybe, if they make the organism sick?\nTeacher: Right! Some **mutations** can be harmful, some have no effect, and some can even be helpful.\n\n---\n\n**Dialogue 6**\nTeacher: Why do scientists study mutations in bacteria?\nStudent: To see how they change over time?\nTeacher: Yes! Mutations help bacteria adapt, and understanding them helps scientists fight diseases.\n\n---\n\n**Dialogue 7**\nTeacher: Imagine a rabbit is born with extra long ears. What could have caused it?\nStudent: Maybe its parents had long ears too?\nTeacher: Partly, but the unusual length could also be due to a **mutation** in its genes.\n\n---\n\n**Dialogue 8**\nTeacher: Do mutations always happen naturally?\nStudent: I think so?\nTeacher: Mostly yes, but they can also happen because of radiation or chemicals. Mutations are just **changes in the DNA**.",
    "gemini-2.5": "Here are eight dialogues following your examples to explain the concept of **mutation**.\n\n## Dialogue 1: The Definition\nTeacher: We're talking about DNA today. What is a **mutation** in simple terms?\nStudent: It’s a mistake or a change in the DNA.\nTeacher: Excellent. Specifically, it's a **change in the sequence of nucleotides** in an organism's DNA, RNA, or genome.\n\n---\n\n## Dialogue 2: Causes\nTeacher: Mutations don't just happen. What are the things that can **cause** these changes in the DNA sequence?\nStudent: Maybe exposure to chemicals or radiation?\nTeacher: That's right. Those are called **mutagens**. Also, errors can happen naturally when the cell is copying its DNA, called a **replication error**.\n\n---\n\n## Dialogue 3: Inheritance\nTeacher: If a mutation happens in a skin cell, will a person's children inherit it?\nStudent: No, because skin cells don't make babies.\nTeacher: Precisely. For a mutation to be passed on, it must occur in **germline cells** (sperm or egg), not **somatic cells** (body cells).\n\n---\n\n## Dialogue 4: Point Mutation\nTeacher: Imagine a sentence: \"THE BIG CAT.\" If I change one letter to \"THE BIT CAT,\" what type of mutation is that?\nStudent: A change in just one spot.\nTeacher: That’s a **point mutation**, the substitution of a single nucleotide in DNA.\n\n---\n\n## Dialogue 5: Frameshift Mutation\nTeacher: Now, if I insert an extra letter, making the sentence: \"THE BBI GCA T...\"? The rest is messed up.\nStudent: It shifted the reading.\nTeacher: Yes. That's a **frameshift mutation**, where insertion or deletion changes how the genetic code is read.\n\n---\n\n## Dialogue 6: Silent Mutations\nTeacher: Can a mutation happen and the protein still work fine?\nStudent: How?\nTeacher: Sometimes, the DNA changes, but the codon still codes for the **same amino acid**. This is a **silent mutation**.\n\n---\n\n## Dialogue 7: Harmful Effects\nTeacher: How can mutations be harmful?\nStudent: They can cause diseases?\nTeacher: Exactly. Mutations that change important proteins can lead to uncontrolled growth — like **cancer**.\n\n---\n\n## Dialogue 8: Beneficial Effects\nTeacher: Can mutations ever help?\nStudent: If they improve survival?\nTeacher: Correct! Beneficial mutations give new traits that help organisms survive. This is the **raw material for evolution**.",
    "claude-3": "## 8 Teaching Dialogues: Understanding Mutation\n\n### Dialogue 1\nTeacher: Have you noticed children look similar to their parents but not exactly the same?\nStudent: Yes! My brother and I have our dad's eyes, but I have mom's curly hair.\nTeacher: Exactly! Sometimes something different appears that neither parent has. This is called a **mutation** — a change in DNA creating a new trait.\n\n---\n\n### Dialogue 2\nTeacher: Why do some organisms look completely different from their parents?\nStudent: Maybe environment changes them?\nTeacher: Sometimes it's deeper — the instructions for growth change. A mistake in DNA is a **mutation**.\n\n---\n\n### Dialogue 3\nTeacher: Fruit flies can have white eyes instead of red. How?\nStudent: Is it a gene change?\nTeacher: Yes! That change is a **mutation**.\n\n---\n\n### Dialogue 4\nTeacher: Why do some animals look different from the typical pattern?\nStudent: Maybe they're sick?\nTeacher: Sometimes their DNA blueprint changes by accident — through radiation, chemicals, or copying errors. That's a **mutation**.\n\n---\n\n### Dialogue 5\nTeacher: Why might a baby have a trait their parents don’t?\nStudent: Maybe from grandparents?\nTeacher: Or a brand new trait! That’s a **mutation** — a sudden DNA change.\n\n---\n\n### Dialogue 6\nTeacher: Why do X-rays come with lead aprons?\nStudent: To protect us?\nTeacher: Right! Radiation can damage DNA and cause **mutations**.\n\n---\n\n### Dialogue 7\nTeacher: What happens to bacteria exposed to chemicals?\nStudent: Do they die?\nTeacher: Sometimes they survive, but their DNA can change. That change is a **mutation**.\n\n---\n\n### Dialogue 8\nTeacher: Why do some people have unique traits?\nStudent: Because of genes?\nTeacher: Correct! Sometimes a gene changes for the first time. That initial change is a **mutation**, creating new variations in a species."
