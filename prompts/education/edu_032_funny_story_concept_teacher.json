    "gpt-5": "Here’s a short, funny story designed for a 7-year-old to understand gravity:\n\n---\n\n**“Gary the Apple and the Great Fall”**\n\nOnce upon a time, in a bright green orchard, there lived a curious little apple named Gary. Gary loved hanging out on his tree branch, looking at the clouds and dreaming about flying.\n\nOne sunny day, Gary shouted to his friend Benny the Bird, “I want to fly like you! I bet I can float up to the sky if I try hard enough!”\n\nBenny flapped his wings and laughed, “Gary, you can’t just float! There’s something called… gravity! It keeps everything on the ground!”\n\nGary tilted his apple-top head. “Gravity? What’s that?”\n\nBenny explained, “Gravity is an invisible force that pulls everything down to the Earth. Even you, Mr. Apple.”\n\n“Hmm… sounds tricky,” said Gary. But before he could think more, a gust of wind shook his branch. Whoosh! Gary tumbled from the tree.\n\n“AHHH!” Gary shouted as he fell… straight down… **plop!** Right into a pile of soft leaves.\n\n“Ouch! That wasn’t flying,” Gary groaned.\n\nBenny chuckled. “See? Gravity made sure you came back down safely.”\n\nGary giggled, shaking his apple-head. “Okay, gravity, I get it. You’re like a superhero who makes sure nobody floats away!”\n\nFrom that day on, Gary didn’t try to fly anymore, but he always remembered the invisible force that kept him grounded. And he told all the new apples, “Gravity is funny, tricky, and very strong—so never fight it!”",
    "gemini-2.5": "Hello there! Today, let's meet a very silly bird and a very powerful invisible friend who lives all around us.\n\n---\n\n## 🐦 Pip's Big Bounce\n\nMeet **Pip**, a little robin with bright blue feathers and a tiny little brain that sometimes forgot things. Pip loved to eat the biggest, reddest apples from Farmer Giles's orchard.\n\nOne sunny morning, Pip landed on the very tip-top branch of the tallest apple tree. \"Aha!\" chirped Pip. \"The perfect apple is right... **up there!**\"\n\nPip saw a huge, shiny apple hanging just above his head. He fluttered his wings and tried to fly *straight up* to grab it, but the apple kept bobbing just out of reach.\n\n\"Hmmph!\" huffed Pip. \"This apple must not like me. Every time I get close, it just **sits there**!\"\n\nSuddenly, a wise old owl named **Professor Hoot** blinked from a lower branch. \"Pip, my dear,\" he said, \"The apple isn't running away. It's staying put because of **Gwendolyn**.\"\n\nPip tilted his head. \"Who is Gwendolyn? Is she a giant invisible girl who likes apples?\"\n\nProfessor Hoot chuckled, \"Not quite! **Gwendolyn the Gravity** is the name for the invisible, super-strong pull that everything on Earth feels. She is always pulling things towards the ground. That's why your apple stays stuck on the branch, and why **you** don't float away when you sneeze!\"\n\nPip thought about this. \"So, if I drop this apple...\"\n\nHe picked the apple with his beak and let go. *WHOOSH!* The apple didn't float up, it didn't float sideways—it went **straight down** with a *plop* onto the soft grass.\n\n\"Wow!\" cried Pip. \"Gwendolyn is very good at pulling!\"\n\nThen, Pip had a brilliant (but mostly silly) idea. He looked down, took a deep breath, and let go of his branch!\n\nInstead of flying gracefully, Pip forgot to flap his wings! He went **WHOOSH** just like the apple, straight toward the ground!\n\n\"Professor Hoot! Gwendolyn is pulling me too fast!\" squeaked Pip.\n\n\"Flap, you silly bird! Flap!\" Professor Hoot shouted, stifling a laugh.\n\nPip remembered his wings just in time and made a very wobbly landing next to his apple.\n\n\"Phew!\" said Pip, dusting his feathers. \"So, Gwendolyn the Gravity is why things **fall down** and why the apple never goes **up** when I drop it, right?\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" winked Professor Hoot. \"**Gwendolyn is like a giant, invisible magnet that pulls everything to the center of the Earth!** And if you stop flapping your wings, she'll pull you right down for a nap!\"\n\nPip happily pecked his apple, thinking, \"**Gwendolyn the Gravity!** What a powerful, silly friend she is!\"",
    "claude-3": "## Professor Wobbles and the Floating Pancakes\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a very silly penguin named Professor Wobbles. He had a big belly, tiny feet, and he was always getting into trouble.\n\nOne morning, Professor Wobbles woke up and thought he had a brilliant idea. \"I'm going to make the BEST pancakes ever!\" he announced to his best friend, Rocket the Rocket (who was actually a small red rocket ship).\n\nProfessor Wobbles flipped the first pancake high into the air. \"Wheeeee!\" he shouted. But then something STRANGE happened. The pancake didn't come back down. It just... floated there.\n\n\"Oh no!\" cried Rocket. \"The gravity is broken!\"\n\n\"What's gravity?\" asked Professor Wobbles, scratching his fuzzy head.\n\nRocket explained: \"Gravity is like an invisible rope that Earth is holding. It pulls everything DOWN down DOWN! Pancakes, penguins, rubber ducks—EVERYTHING! Without gravity, stuff just floats away!\"\n\nProfessor Wobbles looked up at his pancake floating above his head. \"So Earth is like a really strong magnet?\" he asked.\n\n\"Sort of!\" said Rocket. \"Except it's not magnetic. It's just... Earth pulling everything toward itself. It's like Earth is saying, 'Come here, pancake! Come back to me!' And the pancake has to obey!\"\n\nSuddenly—SPLAT! The pancake came zooming down and landed right on Professor Wobbles' head, making a silly \"BONK\" sound.\n\n\"OW!\" giggled Professor Wobbles. \"There's the gravity! It caught me!\"\n\n\"See?\" said Rocket. \"Gravity ALWAYS pulls things down. You can't escape it. You can't be a floating penguin. You'll always come back down.\"\n\nProfessor Wobbles thought for a moment. \"So that's why I can't fly?\"\n\n\"That's exactly why!\" laughed Rocket. \"Gravity keeps you on the ground. It keeps us all where we belong!\"\n\nFrom that day on, Professor Wobbles understood gravity. He still made pancakes, but he was very careful not to flip them TOO high. And whenever something fell, he'd say, \"Aha! There's that sneaky gravity again, pulling things down!\"\n\n**The End!**\n\n### What We Learned:\nGravity is an invisible force that pulls everything toward Earth. It makes things fall down, keeps us on the ground, and is why we don't float away into space! Thank you, gravity! 🌍"
