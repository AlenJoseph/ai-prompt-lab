    "gpt-5": "Nice — here’s a teacher-ready, kid-friendly plan you can use right away with 5-year-olds on **“Parts of a plant.”** Simple, visual, and hands-on.\n\n# 1) Three simple diagram types (good for age 5)\n\n1. **Labelled picture** — a big, clear drawing of a plant with simple labels (root, stem, leaves, flower, seed).\n2. **Life-cycle circle** — 4–5 big pictures arranged in a circle showing Seed → Sprout → Young Plant → Flower → Seed.\n3. **Matching chart (two columns)** — left: pictures of plant parts; right: short words or functions (e.g., “roots — drink water”). Kids draw lines to match.\n\n# 2) Chosen diagram + step-by-step sketch for the board\n\nI’ll pick the **Labelled picture** (best for first introduction).\n\n**Materials:** large whiteboard or chart paper, 3 thick markers (green, brown/black, red/blue), ruler (optional).\n\n**Step-by-step:**\n1. Draw a large pot (wide U-shape) or curved ground line at the bottom.\n2. Add thick curved root lines branching down.\n3. Draw a vertical line up for the stem.\n4. Add 2–3 large oval leaves with center veins.\n5. Draw a simple flower (circle with petals) at the top.\n6. Add a small seed beside or near the plant.\n7. Use another color to draw leader lines for labels.\n8. Label: ROOTS, STEM, LEAVES, FLOWER, SEED (add one-word function under each).\n9. Add fun details like a sun, water drops, or arrows.\n\n**Presentation Tips:** Draw slowly, name each part aloud, and use bright colors.\n\n# 3) Class Activity: “Build-a-Plant” Small-Group Task\n\n**Setup:**\n- Prepare simple cut-outs of plant parts (roots, stem, leaves, flower, seed).\n- Each group gets chart paper, glue, and label cards.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Review the board diagram.\n2. Groups assemble and label their own plant.\n3. Each group presents one part with its function.\n4. Quick quiz: teacher points, class shouts the part name.\n\n**Assessment & Extension:** Provide a coloring or labeling worksheet, or use the same drawing to introduce the plant life cycle later.",
    
    "gemini-2.5": "Hello, class! Today we're learning about the **Parts of a Plant** 🌱.\n\n## 1. Simple Diagram Types\n\n1. **Labelled Diagram:** A drawing with arrows pointing to parts like Leaf, Stem, Root, Flower.\n2. **Cut-away Diagram:** Shows inside and outside of plant parts (like a root or stem section).\n3. **System Diagram:** Divides plant into **Shoot System** (stem, leaves, flower) and **Root System** (roots).\n\n## 2. Diagram Sketch Description: Labelled Diagram\n\n**Step-by-Step:**\n1. Draw a ground line — label it 'Soil'.\n2. Below it, sketch a main root with smaller branching roots.\n3. From the ground up, draw a tall stem.\n4. Add simple oval leaves along the stem.\n5. Draw a flower at the top.\n6. Add label lines and write: Flower, Leaf, Stem, Root.\n\n## 3. Class Activity: “Build-a-Plant” Labeling Race 🏆\n\n**Preparation:** Create sets of paper cut-outs for roots, stems, leaves, and flowers.\n\n**Activity Steps:**\n1. Split students into teams.\n2. Each team assembles and labels a complete plant on chart paper.\n3. The first team to finish correctly wins.\n\nWrap up by reviewing the parts on your board drawing and discussing their functions.",

    "claude-3": "# Parts of a Plant - Teaching Guide\n\n## 1. Three Simple Diagram Types for 5-Year-Olds\n\n1. **Labelled Diagram** — Draw and label each part with arrows.\n2. **Flowchart** — Show stages of plant growth or water movement.\n3. **Tree Diagram** — Start with 'Plant' and branch to parts (roots, stem, leaves).\n\n## 2. Step-by-Step Sketch Description\n\n**Chosen Type:** Labelled Diagram\n\n**Board Sketch Steps:**\n1. Draw a tall stem, a rounded top for leaf, curved lines below for roots.\n2. Add leader lines from leaf, stem, root, and flower.\n3. Label each: Leaf, Stem, Root, Flower.\n4. Optionally add short function notes (e.g., 'Leaf – absorbs sunlight').\n\n## 3. Class Activity: “Build and Label”\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Give each student or pair a blank plant outline.\n2. Have them label or place name cards on the correct parts.\n3. Ask function questions like “Which part drinks water?”\n4. Compare the diagram with a real plant to reinforce learning."
