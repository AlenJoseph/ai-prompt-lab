    "gemini-2.5":  "## Earth's Air Blanket: A Summary for Grade 6 Students 🌎\n\nThe air that surrounds our Earth, called the **atmosphere**, is not just one big layer—it's like a giant blanket made of **five different layers**! Each layer has a special job.\n\n---\n\n### The Five Layers and Their Jobs\nThink of these layers like floors in a building:\n\n1. **Troposphere:** This is the bottom layer, right where we live. All of the **weather** we see—rain, snow, and clouds—happens here.\n2. **Stratosphere:** This layer is next. It contains the **ozone layer**, which acts like sunglasses, blocking dangerous **ultraviolet (UV) radiation)** from the Sun.\n3. **Mesosphere:** The third layer, where meteors burn up when they enter Earth's atmosphere.\n4. **Thermosphere:** The fourth layer, where the northern lights (auroras) appear.\n5. **Exosphere:** The very top layer, where the atmosphere fades into outer space.\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaway\nThe Earth's atmosphere has **five layers** — each with its own role. The **troposphere** gives us weather, and the **stratosphere** protects life with the **ozone layer** that blocks harmful **UV rays**.",
    "claude-3":"# Earth's Atmosphere - Simple Summary\n\n## Main Ideas\n\n**1. Earth has a protective blanket of air called the atmosphere**\n\nThe atmosphere isn't just one big layer - it's actually made up of five different layers stacked on top of each other, like a layer cake! Each layer is special and does different jobs to keep our planet safe and livable.\n\n**2. The five layers have different names and purposes**\nFrom lowest to highest:\n- Troposphere (closest to Earth)\n- Stratosphere\n- Mesosphere\n- Thermosphere\n- Exosphere (farthest from Earth)\n\n**3. Different layers have different temperatures**\nAs you go up, temperatures change — sometimes hotter, sometimes colder!\n\n**4. Each layer has an important job**\n- **Troposphere:** Weather happens here.\n- **Stratosphere:** Has the ozone layer that protects us from harmful UV rays.\n\n---\n\n## Key Terms\n**Atmosphere:** Layers of gases around Earth  \n**Troposphere:** Where we live and where weather happens  \n**Stratosphere:** Contains the ozone layer  \n**Ozone Layer:** Blocks harmful sunlight  \n**UV Radiation:** Dangerous rays from the sun\n\n---\n\n## Takeaway\nThink of Earth's atmosphere like a five-layer shield — it gives us weather and protection from the sun’s rays!"
