    "gpt-5": "Sure! Here’s a quick set of **concept cards** in the same format 👇\n\n---\n\n**Term:** Molecule → Two or more atoms bonded together.\n**Example:** Water (H₂O) is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.\n\n---\n\n**Term:** Element → A pure substance made of only one type of atom.\n**Example:** Oxygen (O), Hydrogen (H), Iron (Fe).\n\n---\n\n**Term:** Compound → A substance made when two or more elements combine chemically.\n**Example:** Carbon dioxide (CO₂), Salt (NaCl).\n\n---\n\n**Term:** Mixture → Two or more substances combined physically but not chemically.\n**Example:** Air, Salad, Saltwater.\n\n---\n\n**Term:** Ion → An atom or molecule with an electric charge due to gain or loss of electrons.\n**Example:** Na⁺ (sodium ion), Cl⁻ (chloride ion).\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to continue with **more chemistry terms** or switch to **another subject** (like physics or biology)?",
    "gemini-2.5": "Sure, here is the quick concept card for Molecule:\n\n### Concept Cards 💡\n\n* **Example 1:**\n    Term: **Atom** → Smallest unit of matter.\n* **Example 2:**\n    Term: **Molecule** → **Two or more atoms chemically bonded together; the smallest unit of a compound that retains its properties.**\n\n---\nLearn more about molecules in chemistry here: [2 Easy Definitions of Molecules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0-sbe7HoEc). This video provides a short explanation of the definition of a molecule.",
