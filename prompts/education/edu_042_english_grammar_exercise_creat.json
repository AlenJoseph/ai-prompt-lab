    "gemini-2.5": "That's a great idea! As an English teacher, I've put together **5 targeted exercises** to help learn and practice key English grammar rules. 📝\n\n---\n\n## 1. Subject-Verb Agreement (Present Simple)\n\nThis exercise focuses on making sure the verb in a sentence agrees in number with its subject, especially with singular subjects in the present simple tense.\n\n* **Rule:** For singular subjects (he, she, it, a name, a singular noun), you must add an **-s** or **-es** to the base form of the verb in the present simple tense. For plural subjects (we, you, they, plural nouns), use the base form of the verb.\n\n| Question | Options |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 1. She always **_____** her coffee black. | (drink / **drinks**) |\n| 2. The children **_____** in the park every afternoon. | (**play** / plays) |\n| 3. He **_____** a quick nap after lunch. | (take / **takes**) |\n| 4. My car **_____** a lot of gas. | (**uses** / use) |\n| 5. They **_____** to the radio on their way to work. | (**listen** / listens) |\n\n### Answers & Explanations\n\n| Q | Answer | Explanation |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 1 | **drinks** | The subject \"She\" is singular (third person singular), so the verb needs an **-s**. |\n| 2 | **play** | The subject \"The children\" is plural, so the verb remains in its base form. |\n| 3 | **takes** | The subject \"He\" is singular, so the verb needs an **-s**. |\n| 4 | **uses** | The subject \"My car\" is singular, so the verb needs an **-s**. |\n| 5 | **listen** | The subject \"They\" is plural, so the verb remains in its base form. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Usage of Articles (a, an, the, or no article)\n\n* **Rule:** Use **'an'** before a word starting with a vowel sound (a, e, i, o, u). Use **'a'** before a word starting with a consonant sound. Use **'the'** for specific or already-mentioned nouns. Use no article for general plural or uncountable nouns.\n\n| Question | Options |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 1. I saw **_____** interesting movie last night. | (**an** / a / the) |\n| 2. **_____** Sun rises in **_____** east. | (A, the / **The, the** / The, a) |\n| 3. She loves listening to **_____** music. | (a / the / **no article**) |\n| 4. Can you pass me **_____** salt, please? | (a / an / **the**) |\n| 5. My sister is **_____** honest person. | (a / **an** / the) |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Comparison of Adjectives (Comparative and Superlative)\n\n* **Rule:** For short adjectives, add **-er** (comparative) and **-est** (superlative). For longer adjectives, use **more/most**. Some are irregular (good → better → best).\n\n| Question | Options |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 1. This book is **_____** than the last one I read. | (gooder / **better** / the best) |\n| 2. She is the **_____** student in the entire class. | (smarter / **smartest** / smart) |\n| 3. Learning Chinese is **_____** than learning Spanish. | (**more difficult** / difficulter / most difficult) |\n| 4. That was the **_____** day of my life! | (happier / **happiest** / most happy) |\n| 5. This exercise is **_____** complicated than the first one. | (most / no article / **less**) |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Verb Tense Consistency (Past Simple and Present Perfect)\n\n* **Rule:** Use **Past Simple** for specific past time (yesterday, last week). Use **Present Perfect** for actions with unspecific or ongoing time (ever, never, since, for).\n\n| Question | Options |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 1. I **_____** to London three years ago. | (**went** / have gone) |\n| 2. We **_____** in this city since 2018. | (lived / **have lived**) |\n| 3. She **_____** never **_____** Japanese food before. | (did, try / **has, tried**) |\n| 4. They **_____** their project an hour ago. | (**finished** / have finished) |\n| 5. **_____** you **_____** a good book lately? | (Did, read / **Have, read**) |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Pronoun Case (Subject vs. Object)\n\n* **Rule:** Use **Subject Pronouns** (I, he, she, we, they) for doers of action; **Object Pronouns** (me, him, her, us, them) for receivers of action.\n\n| Question | Options |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 1. Sarah and **_____** went to the store. | (**I** / me) |\n| 2. The teacher gave the prize to **_____**. | (she / **her**) |\n| 3. Please send the document to John and **_____**. | (**me** / I) |\n| 4. **_____** are going to visit the museum tomorrow. | (**We** / Us) |\n| 5. He spoke about the incident to **_____**. | (they / **them**) |",
    "claude-3": "# 5 English Grammar Exercises\n\n## Exercise 1: Present Simple Tense\n\n### Fill in the Blank\nComplete the sentences using the correct form of the verb in parentheses.\n\n1. She _______ (work) as a teacher at a local school.\n2. They _______ (not like) spicy food.\n3. _______ you _______ (play) football on weekends?\n4. My brother _______ (study) engineering at university.\n5. The sun _______ (rise) in the east every morning.\n\n### Answers\n1. works\n2. do not like / don't like\n3. Do, play\n4. studies\n5. rises\n\n### Grammar Rule Explanation\nThe Present Simple tense is used to express habits, routines, general truths, and facts. For third person singular subjects (he, she, it), we add \"-s\" or \"-es\" to the base form of the verb. For negative sentences, we use \"do not\" or \"does not\" (doesn't) before the verb. For questions, we invert the subject and auxiliary verb \"do/does.\"\n\n---\n\n## Exercise 2: Past Simple Tense\n\n### Fill in the Blank\nComplete the sentences with the past simple form of the verbs in parentheses.\n\n1. I _______ (go) to Paris last summer.\n2. She _______ (eat) lunch before the meeting _______ (start).\n3. They _______ (not attend) the concert yesterday.\n4. _______ you _______ (see) that movie last weekend?\n5. He _______ (write) three books during his career.\n\n### Answers\n1. went\n2. ate, started\n3. did not attend / didn't attend\n4. Did, see\n5. wrote\n\n### Grammar Rule Explanation\nThe Past Simple tense describes completed actions that happened at a specific time in the past. Regular verbs add \"-ed\" to the base form, while irregular verbs have unique past forms (go→went, eat→ate, write→wrote). In negative sentences, we use \"did not\" + base form. For questions with Past Simple, we use \"Did\" + subject + base form of the verb.\n\n---\n\n## Exercise 3: Present Perfect Tense\n\n### Fill in the Blank\nFill in the blanks with the Present Perfect form of the verbs in parentheses.\n\n1. I _______ (live) in this city for ten years.\n2. She _______ (finish) her project yet? (make this a question)\n3. They _______ (not visit) that museum before.\n4. _______ you ever _______ (try) Indian food?\n5. He _______ (work) here since 2020.\n\n### Answers\n1. have lived\n2. Has, finished\n3. have not visited / haven't visited\n4. Have, tried\n5. has worked\n\n### Grammar Rule Explanation\nThe Present Perfect tense connects the past and present, showing actions that started in the past and continue to the present or have just been completed. It is formed with \"have/has\" + past participle. We use \"have\" with I, you, we, they and \"has\" with he, she, it. This tense is commonly used with \"for\" (duration) or \"since\" (specific point in time).\n\n---\n\n## Exercise 4: Comparative and Superlative Adjectives\n\n### Fill in the Blank\nComplete the sentences with the correct comparative or superlative form of the adjectives in parentheses.\n\n1. This book is _______ (interesting) than the last one.\n2. She is the _______ (tall) girl in our class.\n3. A car is _______ (fast) than a bicycle.\n4. This is the _______ (good) restaurant in town.\n5. His apartment is _______ (expensive) than hers.\n\n### Answers\n1. more interesting\n2. tallest\n3. faster\n4. best\n5. more expensive\n\n### Grammar Rule Explanation\nComparative adjectives compare two things and are formed by adding \"-er\" to short adjectives (fast→faster) or using \"more\" before longer adjectives (interesting→more interesting). Superlative adjectives describe the highest degree and use \"-est\" for short adjectives (tall→tallest) or \"most/the most\" for longer adjectives. Irregular adjectives include good→better→best and bad→worse→worst.\n\n---\n\n## Exercise 5: Articles (A, An, The)\n\n### Fill in the Blank\nFill in the blanks with the correct article: a, an, or the.\n\n1. I saw _______ elephant at _______ zoo yesterday.\n2. She is studying _______ English language.\n3. Can you pass me _______ salt? _______ salt is on _______ table.\n4. He is _______ doctor and she is _______ lawyer.\n5. _______ moon is _______ natural satellite of _______ Earth.\n\n### Answers\n1. an, the\n2. the\n3. the, The, the\n4. a, a\n5. The, a, the\n\n### Grammar Rule Explanation\nThe indefinite articles \"a\" and \"an\" refer to non-specific nouns. Use \"a\" before consonant sounds (a teacher, a book) and \"an\" before vowel sounds (an apple, an hour). The definite article \"the\" refers to specific, known nouns. Use \"the\" when both speaker and listener know which noun is being discussed. We also use \"the\" with unique things (the sun, the moon) and with specific nouns mentioned earlier in the text. Omit articles with plural nouns in general statements (Doctors are helpful) and with most uncountable nouns in general contexts."
