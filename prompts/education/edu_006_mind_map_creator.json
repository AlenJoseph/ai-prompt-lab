    "gemini-2.5": "## Photosynthesis Study Mind Map Outline üåø\n\nThis outline uses a central topic with branching subtopics and key terms to create a structure for a mind map, helping students visualize the process of photosynthesis.\n\n---\n\n### Central Topic: Photosynthesis\n\n**Definition:** The process used by plants, algae, and some bacteria to convert light energy, usually from the Sun, into chemical energy (food/glucose).\n\n---\n\n### Branch 1: The Reactants (What Goes In) ‚òÄÔ∏èüíßüí®\n* **1.1. Water (H‚ÇÇO):**\n    * **Source:** Absorbed from the soil through the roots.\n    * **Transport:** Moved up through the plant via the xylem vessels.\n* **1.2. Carbon Dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ):**\n    * **Source:** Absorbed from the air.\n    * **Entry Point:** Enters the leaf through small pores called stomata (singular: stoma).\n* **1.3. Light Energy:**\n    * **Source:** Primarily the Sun.\n    * **Capture:** Absorbed by the pigment chlorophyll.\n\n---\n\n### Branch 2: The Location and Machinery üî¨\n* **2.1. Plant Organ:** Leaves (the primary site).\n* **2.2. Cell Organelle:** Chloroplasts (contain the machinery).\n* **2.3. Key Pigment:** Chlorophyll\n    * **Function:** Captures light energy (mostly red and blue light).\n    * **Result:** Gives plants their green color (reflects green light).\n* **2.4. Key Structure:** Thylakoids and Stroma (where the two main stages occur).\n\n---\n\n### Branch 3: The Process/Stages üß™\n* **3.1. Stage 1: Light-Dependent Reactions (The \"Photo\" Part)**\n    * **Requires:** Light and Water.\n    * **Location:** Thylakoid membranes within the chloroplast.\n    * **Action:** Light energy ‚Üí ATP & NADPH; Water ‚Üí Oxygen.\n* **3.2. Stage 2: Light-Independent Reactions (The \"Synthesis\" Part / Calvin Cycle)**\n    * **Requires:** CO‚ÇÇ, ATP, NADPH.\n    * **Location:** Stroma.\n    * **Action:** CO‚ÇÇ fixed into Glucose.\n\n---\n\n### Branch 4: The Products (What Comes Out) üçöüå¨Ô∏è\n* **4.1. Glucose (C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇO‚ÇÜ):**\n    * **Function:** Plant‚Äôs food source.\n    * **Storage:** Stored as starch or used to build cellulose.\n* **4.2. Oxygen (O‚ÇÇ):**\n    * **Function:** Released into the atmosphere.\n    * **Importance:** Used in respiration by most living organisms.\n\n---\n\n### Branch 5: The Summary Equation üìù\n* **Equation:** 6CO‚ÇÇ + 6H‚ÇÇO + Light Energy ‚Üí C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇO‚ÇÜ + 6O‚ÇÇ\n* **Translation:** Carbon Dioxide + Water + Light Energy ‚Üí Glucose + Oxygen",
