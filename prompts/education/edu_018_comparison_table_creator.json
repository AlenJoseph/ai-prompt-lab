    "gemini-2.5": "## 🔬 Physical Change vs. Chemical Change: A Comparison\n\nThis table helps you compare **Physical Changes** and **Chemical Changes**, which are two main ways that matter can transform.\n\n| Feature | Physical Change (e.g., Melting Ice) | Chemical Change (e.g., Burning Wood) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Definition** | A change where only the **physical properties** (like size, shape, or state) of a substance are altered, but **no new substance** is formed. | A change where a substance transforms into **one or more entirely new substances** with different chemical properties. |\n| **New Substance Formed?** | **No**. The original substance remains the same, even if its appearance changes. (e.g., Ice is water (H₂O), and liquid water is still water (H₂O)). | **Yes**. A new substance with a new chemical composition is produced. (e.g., Wood turns into ash, smoke, and gases). |\n| **Reversibility** | **Generally Reversible**. You can usually get the original substance back easily. | **Usually Irreversible**. It is often very difficult or impossible to get the original substance back. |\n| **Change in Composition** | **No change** in the chemical nature or molecular composition. | **Change** in the chemical nature or molecular composition (chemical bonds are broken and new ones are formed). |\n| **Energy Change** | Energy (like heat) may be absorbed or released, but it is typically **less** than in a chemical change. | Energy (like heat, light, or sound) is **often absorbed or released** in large amounts. |\n| **Examples** | * Melting ice to water * Tearing paper * Dissolving sugar in water * Cutting vegetables * Boiling water into steam | * Burning paper or wood * Rusting of iron * Cooking food (like baking a cake) * Digestion of food * Mixing vinegar and baking soda (produces gas) |\n\n***\n\n### 🤝 Similarities Between Physical and Chemical Changes\n\nBoth types of changes have a few things in common:\n\n* **Change is Involved:** Both physical and chemical changes involve a substance becoming different in some way.\n* **Energy Transfer:** Both changes usually involve a transfer of energy (heat is often absorbed or given off).\n* **Matter is Conserved:** In both cases, the **total amount of matter** (mass) remains the same—it is just rearranged or transformed, according to the Law of Conservation of Mass.\n\n***\n\n### 🚩 How to Spot a Chemical Change (Clues)\n\nSince chemical changes create new substances, they often give off clues that a reaction has happened! Look for these signs:\n\n* **Change in Color** (e.g., fruit turning brown after being cut).\n* **Production of Gas** (e.g., bubbling or fizzing).\n* **Formation of a Solid** (a solid called a **precipitate** forms when two liquids are mixed).\n* **Production of Heat or Light** (e.g., fire or an explosion).\n* **Change in Odour** (e.g., milk turning sour).\n\nWould you like to explore some **real-world examples** of these changes in more detail?",
    "claude-3": "## 🧬 Physical Change vs Chemical Change (Grade 7 Science)\n\n| **Aspect** | **Physical Change** | **Chemical Change** |\n|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| **Definition** | A change in which the form or appearance of a substance changes, but the substance remains the same. | A change in which a new substance is formed with different properties and composition. |\n| **Reversibility** | Usually reversible — you can undo the change and get the original substance back. | Usually irreversible — you cannot easily get the original substances back. |\n| **Molecular Structure** | The arrangement of molecules changes, but the molecules themselves stay the same. | The molecules break apart and rearrange to form completely new substances. |\n| **Energy** | Usually requires small amounts of energy. | Usually releases or absorbs large amounts of energy (heat, light, or sound). |\n| **Observable Signs** | Changes in size, shape, color, state, or density. No new substances formed. | Color change, gas production, heat release, light, smell, or formation of precipitate. |\n| **Mass** | The mass remains the same before and after the change. | The mass remains the same (Law of Conservation of Mass), but different substances are formed. |\n\n---\n\n### 🌟 **Similarities**\n\n* Both involve changes to matter.\n* In both types of changes, the total mass is conserved (doesn't disappear).\n* Both can be caused by adding or removing energy (heat, light, or pressure).\n* Both result in a different appearance or state of the substance.\n\n---\n\n### 🔬 **Differences**\n\n| **Feature** | **Physical Change** | **Chemical Change** |\n|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| **New Substances** | No new substances are formed. | New substances are created. |\n| **Reversibility** | Usually reversible. | Usually irreversible. |\n| **Molecular Level** | Molecules stay the same. | Molecules change and form new ones. |\n| **Energy Involved** | Less energy involved. | More energy involved. |\n| **Detectability** | Simple physical observation (shape, size). | Noticeable signs like color change, gas, or heat. |\n\n---\n\n### 🧪 **Examples**\n\n**Physical Changes:**\n- Ice melting into water (can refreeze to get ice back).\n- Cutting paper (same material, smaller pieces).\n- Dissolving salt in water (can get salt back by evaporation).\n\n**Chemical Changes:**\n- Burning wood (forms ash, gases — cannot be undone).\n- Rusting of iron (new substance, iron oxide, is formed).\n- Cooking an egg (irreversible change in proteins).\n- Milk turning sour (bacteria create new substances).\n"
