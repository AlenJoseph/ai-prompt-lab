  "prompt": "Explain the given topic with a clear definition, main idea, and examples.\nExample 1:\nTopic: Gravity  \nDefinition: Gravity is the force that pulls things toward the center of the Earth.  \nMain Explanation: It keeps us on the ground and makes objects fall when dropped.  \nExamples: An apple falling from a tree, planets orbiting the sun.\n\nExample 2:\nTopic: Photosynthesis  \nDefinition: Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants make their own food using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water.  \nMain Explanation: It happens in the leaves using chlorophyll. Plants convert CO₂ and water into glucose and oxygen.  \nExamples: Trees, grass, and algae perform photosynthesis.\n\nNow, explain this topic in the same format:\nTopic: {Topic}\n\nTopic: {Topic}",

    "gpt-5": "**Topic:** Mutation\n\n**Definition:**\nA mutation is a change in the DNA sequence of an organism’s genetic material.\n\n**Main Explanation:**\nMutations can occur naturally during cell division or be caused by external factors like radiation or chemicals. They may alter a gene’s structure, leading to changes in the traits or characteristics of an organism. Some mutations are harmful, some are beneficial, and others have no noticeable effect. Mutations are an important source of genetic variation and play a key role in evolution.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Sickle cell anemia caused by a mutation in the hemoglobin gene.\n- Blue eyes resulting from a mutation that reduces melanin production.\n- Antibiotic resistance in bacteria due to gene mutations.",
    "gemini-2.5": "## 🧬 Topic: Mutation\n\n| Category | Explanation |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Definition** | A **mutation** is a permanent, random change in the **DNA sequence** of an organism. |\n| **Main Explanation** | DNA holds the instructions for building and operating an organism. A mutation occurs when the DNA is copied incorrectly (a **copying error**) during cell division, or when it's damaged by environmental factors (like radiation or chemicals). These changes can alter the resulting protein, sometimes making it non-functional, different, or even better suited to the environment. Mutations are the ultimate source of all **genetic variation** and are crucial for **evolution**.  |\n| **Examples** | * **Sickle Cell Anemia:** A mutation in a single base pair of the gene for hemoglobin changes the shape of red blood cells. <br> * **Antibiotic Resistance in Bacteria:** A random mutation allows a bacterium to survive exposure to an antibiotic, passing that resistance to its offspring. <br> * **Blue Eyes in Humans:** A specific mutation that occurred thousands of years ago in a single ancestor is responsible for all blue-eyed people today. |",
    "claude-3": "# Mutation\n\n**Definition:** A mutation is a change in the DNA sequence of an organism's genes that can alter how traits are inherited or expressed.\n\n**Main Explanation:** Mutations occur when errors happen during DNA replication or when DNA is damaged by environmental factors. They can affect a single gene or involve larger sections of DNA. Some mutations are beneficial, allowing organisms to adapt to their environment. Others are harmful, potentially causing disease or dysfunction. Many mutations have no noticeable effect at all. Mutations are the primary source of genetic variation in populations, which is essential for evolution and natural selection to occur. Without mutations, all organisms would be genetically identical to their parents, and species couldn't adapt to changing conditions.\n\n**Examples:** A classic example is the mutation in fruit flies that produces white eyes instead of the normal red eyes. In humans, mutations can cause cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, or color blindness. Beneficial mutations include the ability of certain bacteria to resist antibiotics, or variations in human skin color that help people adapt to different sunlight levels. The spots or stripes on a leopard can result from mutations affecting pigmentation genes. Even the dark coloring of peppered moths during the Industrial Revolution was due to mutations that became more common as pollution darkened tree bark."
