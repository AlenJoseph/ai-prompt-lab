Here’s a **text-based flowchart** for the **Water Cycle**, following the same clear step-by-step style as your example 👇\n\n---\n\n### **Topic: Water Cycle**\n\n**Flowchart:**\nEvaporation (from oceans, lakes, rivers)\n↓\nCondensation (water vapor forms clouds)\n↓\nPrecipitation (rain, snow, sleet, or hail falls to Earth)\n↓\nCollection (water gathers in rivers, lakes, oceans, and groundwater)\n↓\n**Cycle Repeats**\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of Steps:**\n\n1. **Evaporation:** The sun heats water, turning it into vapor.\n2. **Condensation:** The vapor cools and forms clouds.\n3. **Precipitation:** Water falls back to the Earth as rain or snow.\n4. **Collection:** Water collects again in oceans, lakes, and rivers — ready to evaporate once more.\n\n---",
