    "gpt-5": "✅ **Corrected Sentence:** She **doesn’t like** apples.\n\n### 🔍 Explanation:\n\n1. **Error Type:** Subject–verb agreement and verb form.\n2. **Correction Details:**\n   - The subject **“She”** is singular, so the auxiliary verb should be **“does”**, not **“do.”**\n   - When we use **“doesn’t” (does not)**, the main verb (**like**) must be in its **base form**, not **“likes.”**\n3. **Grammar Rule:**\n   - In the simple present tense:\n     - Use **“do”** with plural subjects (e.g., *They don’t like apples.*)\n     - Use **“does”** with singular subjects (e.g., *She doesn’t like apples.*)\n\n✅ **Final Answer:** *She doesn’t like apples.*",

    "claude-3": "**Incorrect:** She don't likes apples.\n\n**Correct:** She doesn't like apples.\n\n---\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Subject–Verb Agreement:** “She” is third person singular, so use **“doesn't”** instead of **“don’t.”**\n2. **Verb Form:** After **“doesn’t,”** the verb must be in its **base form** — **“like,”** not **“likes.”**\n3. **Extra Word Removed:** “grammatically” at the end was unnecessary and incorrect in context.\n\n✅ **Final Answer:** She doesn’t like apples."
