    "gpt-5": "* **Definition:** An electric circuit is a closed path through which electric current flows, consisting of components like resistors, wires, and power sources.\n  **Importance:** It allows electricity to power devices by providing a controlled flow of electrons.\n  **Example:** A simple torch circuit with a battery, switch, and bulb.\n  **Application:** Used in household wiring, electronic gadgets, and industrial machinery.\n\n* **Definition:** Series circuit connects components end-to-end so the same current flows through all.\n  **Importance:** Helps in maintaining uniform current and easy control with a single switch.\n  **Example:** Decorative string lights.\n  **Application:** Used in low-power circuits and testing setups.\n\n* **Definition:** Parallel circuit connects components across the same voltage source, allowing multiple paths for current.\n  **Importance:** Ensures that one component’s failure doesn’t affect others.\n  **Example:** Home electrical wiring.\n  **Application:** Used in residential and commercial electrical systems for reliability.",
    
    "gemini-2.5": "**💡 Key Points About Electric Circuits**\n\n* **Definition & Importance:** An electric circuit is a **closed path** that allows for the continuous flow of **electric current** (a flow of charged particles, typically electrons) from a power source, through components, and back to the source. It is **fundamental** to all modern electrical and electronic technology as it enables the controlled conversion of electrical energy into other forms of energy (like light, heat, or motion).\n    * **Example/Application:** A **simple flashlight** uses a circuit where a battery (source) connects to a bulb (load) via conducting wires, and a switch controls the completion of the path.\n* **Essential Components & Function:** All circuits require at least a **power source** (e.g., battery or generator) to provide energy/voltage, **conductors** (e.g., wires) to form the path, and a **load** (e.g., bulb, motor, resistor) which consumes the electrical energy and performs the useful work.\n    * **Example/Application:** **Household wiring** is a complex system of parallel circuits, ensuring that devices like lights, refrigerators, and computers can operate **independently** on the same voltage, which is crucial for reliability.\n* **Types & Control:** Circuits are commonly classified as **Series** (single path for current) or **Parallel** (multiple paths for current). A key feature of circuits is the ability to **control** the current flow using devices like **switches** (to open/close the circuit) or **fuses/circuit breakers** (to automatically open the circuit for safety against excessive current).\n    * **Example/Application:** **Circuit breakers** are safety applications found in every home's electrical panel. When an appliance or wiring causes a **short circuit** or **overload**, the breaker 'breaks' the circuit to prevent fire and equipment damage.\n\n***\nThis video explains [How Do Circuits Work? Volts, Amps, Ohm's, and Watts Explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_asax7PmhcE) by detailing the basic principles that govern electricity's flow within a circuit.",

    "claude-3": "• **Definition**: An electric circuit is a closed path through which electric current flows from a power source (like a battery) through various components (resistors, switches, bulbs) and back to the source. **Importance**: Circuits are fundamental to all electrical devices and systems, enabling the controlled flow of electricity to perform useful work. **Example**: A simple flashlight circuit with a battery, switch, and LED bulb. **Application**: Used in everyday devices like smartphones, computers, home lighting systems, and power distribution networks.\n\n• **Definition**: A complete circuit requires a continuous path with no breaks; if the circuit is open (broken), current cannot flow. **Importance**: Understanding open and closed circuits is critical for controlling when devices turn on or off and for safety purposes. **Example**: A light switch that opens or closes the circuit to control whether a lamp turns on or off. **Application**: All switches in homes and devices operate on this principle, from simple on/off switches to complex circuit breakers that protect against electrical overload.\n\n• **Definition**: Ohm's Law states that current (I) flowing through a circuit equals voltage (V) divided by resistance (R), expressed as I = V/R. **Importance**: This fundamental relationship allows engineers to design and analyze circuits, predict how much current will flow, and ensure components work safely. **Example**: A 12-volt battery connected to a 4-ohm resistor produces a current of 3 amperes. **Application**: Essential in designing electrical systems, calculating proper wire gauges, selecting appropriate resistors for circuits, and troubleshooting electrical problems in devices and industrial equipment."
