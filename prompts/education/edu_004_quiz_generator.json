    "gemini-2.5":  "## Physics Quiz for Grade 10 Students ‚öõÔ∏è\n\nThis quiz covers fundamental concepts often taught in **Grade 10 Physics**, including motion, forces, and basic electricity.\n\n---\n\n### Questions\n\n1. What is the **SI unit** for **force**?\n2. Define **velocity** and state whether it is a scalar or a vector quantity.\n3. State **Newton's First Law of Motion** in your own words.\n4. If a car travels 300 kilometers in 5 hours, what is its **average speed**?\n5. What is the main difference between **mass** and **weight**?\n6. An object is accelerating at a rate of 5 m/s¬≤ and has a mass of 10 kg. What is the **net force** acting on it? (Show the formula used.)\n7. What is the SI unit for **electric current**?\n8. True or False: The rate of change of velocity is called **acceleration**.\n9. Which fundamental force is responsible for keeping the planets in orbit around the Sun?\n10. Give an example of a simple **electrical conductor** and an **electrical insulator**.\n\n---\n\n### Answers\n\n1. The SI unit for force is the **Newton (N)**.\n2. **Velocity** is the rate of change of an object's position. It is a **vector** quantity because it has both magnitude and direction.\n3. **Newton's First Law of Motion:** An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted on by an external force.\n4. **Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time** ‚Üí 300 km / 5 h = **60 km/h**.\n5. **Mass** is the amount of matter (constant), while **weight** is the gravitational force acting on it (variable).\n6. **F = m √ó a** ‚Üí 10 kg √ó 5 m/s¬≤ = **50 N**.\n7. SI unit for electric current: **Ampere (A)**.\n8. **True.**\n9. **Gravity**.\n10. **Conductor:** Copper or aluminum. **Insulator:** Rubber or plastic."
