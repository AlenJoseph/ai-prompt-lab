    "gpt-5": "Sure! Let’s dive deep into **Newton’s Laws of Motion** — one of the most important foundations of physics — with **simple explanations** and **real-world examples** that make them easy to understand and remember.\n\n---\n\n## 🌍 **Introduction**\n\nSir **Isaac Newton** formulated **three laws of motion** in the 17th century that describe how objects move and interact with forces. They form the basis for understanding everything from how cars move 🚗 to how rockets launch 🚀.\n\n---\n\n## ⚖️ **Newton’s First Law of Motion – Law of Inertia**\n\n### 🧠 **Statement:**\n> “An object will remain at rest or continue to move in a straight line at constant speed unless acted upon by an external unbalanced force.”\n\n### 💡 **Meaning:**\nThis law tells us that **objects resist changes** to their state of motion. If something is not moving, it won’t move unless a force acts on it. If it’s moving, it will keep moving in the same way unless something stops or changes it.\n\n### 🏠 **Real-World Examples:**\n1. **A ball on the ground stays still** until someone kicks it. → The kick is the external force.\n2. **When a car suddenly stops**, passengers jerk forward. → Their bodies want to keep moving at the same speed (inertia).\n3. **A book on a table** will not move unless you push it. → No force, no change in motion.\n\n### ⚙️ **Concept Keyword:**\n👉 **Inertia** = resistance to change in motion.\n\n---\n\n## 🏃‍♂️ **Newton’s Second Law of Motion – Law of Force and Acceleration**\n\n### 🧠 **Statement:**\n> “The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.”\n\n### ⚙️ **Formula:**\nF = m × a\n\nwhere:\n- **F** = Force (in newtons, N)\n- **m** = Mass (in kilograms, kg)\n- **a** = Acceleration (in m/s²)\n\n### 💡 **Meaning:**\nIf you apply more force, the object accelerates more. If the object is heavier (more mass), it accelerates less for the same force.\n\n### 🏠 **Real-World Examples:**\n1. **Pushing a shopping cart:** An empty cart moves faster than a full one with the same push. → More mass → less acceleration.\n2. **Car acceleration:** A powerful engine gives more force, so the car speeds up quickly.\n3. **Throwing a cricket ball vs. a football:** The same arm force throws the lighter cricket ball farther because it has less mass.\n\n### ⚙️ **Concept Keyword:**\n👉 **Force causes acceleration.**\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 **Newton’s Third Law of Motion – Law of Action and Reaction**\n\n### 🧠 **Statement:**\n> “For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.”\n\n### 💡 **Meaning:**\nWhenever one object applies a force on another, the second object pushes back with an equal force in the opposite direction.\n\n### 🏠 **Real-World Examples:**\n1. **Walking:** You push the ground backward; the ground pushes you forward. → That’s why you move.\n2. **Rocket launch:** The rocket pushes gases downward; gases push the rocket upward.\n3. **Jumping off a boat:** You move forward, and the boat moves backward — equal and opposite reaction.\n\n### ⚙️ **Concept Keyword:**\n👉 **Action = Reaction (opposite in direction).**\n\n---\n\n## 🔁 **Summary Table**\n\n| Law | Description | Formula | Keyword | Example |\n|-----|--------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| 1st Law | Object remains at rest/motion unless force acts | — | Inertia | Book stays still unless pushed |\n| 2nd Law | Force = mass × acceleration | F = m × a | Acceleration | Pushing a shopping cart |\n| 3rd Law | Every action has equal & opposite reaction | — | Reaction | Rocket launch |\n\n---\n\n## 🌟 **Connecting to Real Life**\n\n| Everyday Situation | Newton’s Law Involved | Explanation |\n|--------------------|------------------------|--------------|\n| Wearing a seatbelt in a car | 1st Law | Prevents inertia from throwing you forward during a sudden stop |\n| Kicking a football harder | 2nd Law | More force → more acceleration |\n| Swimming | 3rd Law | Push water backward → move forward |\n\n---\n\n## 🧭 **In Short:**\n- **1st Law:** No force → no change.\n- **2nd Law:** More force → more acceleration.\n- **3rd Law:** Every push → opposite push back.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to create a **colorful visual diagram or infographic** that shows all three laws with examples (for classroom or presentation use)?",
    "gemini-2.5": "🚀 The Three Laws of Motion: Governing the World Around Us\n\nSir Isaac Newton's three laws of motion are fundamental principles of physics that describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and the body's resulting motion. Understanding them is key to understanding how nearly everything in the universe moves or stays still.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Newton's First Law: The Law of Inertia\n### The Concept\nAn object at rest stays at **rest**, and an object in motion stays in **motion** with the same speed and in the same direction **unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force**.\n\nThis tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion is called **inertia**. The more mass an object has, the greater its inertia.\n\n### Real-World Examples\n* **Driving Safety (Seatbelts):** When a car traveling at high speed suddenly brakes, your body wants to continue moving forward due to inertia. The **seatbelt** provides the unbalanced external force that stops your forward motion.\n* **The Tablecloth Trick:** A magician pulls a tablecloth quickly from under dishes without disturbing them. The dishes, being at rest, remain so due to inertia.\n* **Space Travel:** A spacecraft coasting through space will continue moving indefinitely since there are almost no external forces.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Newton's Second Law: Force and Acceleration\n### The Concept\nThe acceleration (a) of an object is directly proportional to the net force (F) acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass (m):\n\nF = m × a\n\nThis means an object accelerates more when more force is applied or when its mass is smaller.\n\n### Real-World Examples\n* **Pushing Carts:** Easier to push an empty shopping cart than a full one.\n* **Throwing a Ball:** Greater throwing force → faster acceleration.\n* **Car vs. Truck:** A car accelerates faster than a truck with the same engine force.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Newton's Third Law: Action and Reaction\n### The Concept\nFor every **action**, there is an **equal and opposite reaction**. Forces always occur in **pairs** and act on **different objects**.\n\n### Real-World Examples\n* **Walking:** You push the ground backward; it pushes you forward.\n* **Rocket Propulsion:** Gases are expelled downward; rocket moves upward.\n* **Jumping off a Boat:** You move forward; the boat moves backward.\n\n---\n\nWould you like to explore how these laws are applied in a specific field, like sports or engineering?",
    "claude-3": "# Newton's Laws of Motion: A Deep Dive\n\nNewton's three laws of motion are the foundation of classical physics and explain how objects move and interact with forces. Let’s break them down with real-world examples.\n\n## First Law: The Law of Inertia\n**Theory:** An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force.\n\n**Examples:**\n- When a car suddenly stops, passengers lurch forward due to inertia.\n- A magician pulls a tablecloth from under dishes without moving them.\n- A spacecraft coasting through space continues moving without needing an engine.\n\n---\n\n## Second Law: The Law of Acceleration\n**Theory:** Force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma). Acceleration depends on both the net force and the object's mass.\n\n**Examples:**\n- A shopping cart accelerates faster than a car with the same push.\n- A tennis ball flies farther than a bowling ball with the same throw.\n- A sprinter pushes hard on the ground to accelerate quickly.\n\n---\n\n## Third Law: Action and Reaction\n**Theory:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Jumping pushes Earth down while you move upward.\n- Rockets expel gas downward, pushing the rocket upward.\n- Birds push air downward with wings to fly.\n\n---\n\n**Bringing It Together – A Basketball Game:**\n- **1st Law:** The ball stays still until kicked.\n- **2nd Law:** A stronger kick → faster acceleration.\n- **3rd Law:** The ball pushes back on your foot equally.\n\nThese laws explain how everything moves — from cars to rockets — and form the foundation of modern mechanics."
