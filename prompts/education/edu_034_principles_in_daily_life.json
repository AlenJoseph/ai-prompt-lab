    "claude-3": "Newton's laws of motion are constantly at work in everyday situations, even if we don't always think about them explicitly. Here's how they apply:\n\n**First Law (Inertia):** Objects at rest stay at rest, and objects in motion stay in motion unless acted upon by a force.\n- When you're in a car that suddenly brakes, you lurch forward because your body wants to keep moving at the same speed—there's no force acting on you to make you stop. This is why seatbelts are essential; they provide the force needed to decelerate your body along with the car. Similarly, when a car accelerates from a stop, you feel pushed back into your seat because your body resists the change in motion. Even simple things like a ball rolling across the floor eventually stopping happen because friction (a force) acts against its motion.\n\n**Second Law (F = ma):** The acceleration of an object depends on the force applied and its mass.\n- This explains why it's easier to push an empty shopping cart than a full one—the full cart has more mass, so you need to apply more force to get the same acceleration. When you kick a soccer ball gently versus hard, the harder kick applies more force, resulting in greater acceleration and a faster ball. Even walking involves this principle: your muscles apply force to push your body forward, with heavier people needing to exert more force to achieve the same walking speed as lighter people.\n\n**Third Law (Action-Reaction):** For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.\n- When you jump, you push down on the ground (action), and the ground pushes up on you with equal force (reaction), propelling you into the air. When you walk, you push backward on the ground, and the ground pushes forward on you, moving you ahead. Swimmers push water backward to move forward. Even when you throw a ball, the ball pushes back on your hand (though you don't notice it much because the ball is lighter than you).\n\nThese principles are woven into virtually everything we do—driving, playing sports, cooking, climbing stairs—making Newton's laws fundamental to understanding the physical world around us."
