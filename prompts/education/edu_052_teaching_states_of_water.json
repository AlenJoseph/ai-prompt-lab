    "gpt-5": "Sure! Let’s explain the **states of water** in a very simple way for students:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Water boils at 100°C**\n* When water is heated to **100°C**, it starts **boiling**.\n* Boiling means water changes from **liquid** to **gas** (steam).\n* Tiny bubbles form in the water and rise to the surface.\n* This is called **evaporation by heating**.\n* Example: When you boil water to make tea, the steam you see is water turning into gas.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Water freezes at 0°C**\n* When water is cooled to **0°C**, it **freezes**.\n* Freezing means water changes from **liquid** to **solid** (ice).\n* The molecules in water slow down and stick together tightly to form ice.\n* Example: Water in a freezer becomes ice cubes.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Water evaporates when heated by the sun or another heat source**\n* Even at temperatures below 100°C, water can **evaporate** slowly.\n* Evaporation means water changes from **liquid** to **gas**.\n* The heat from the sun or any source gives energy to water molecules to escape into the air as vapor.\n* Example: Puddles disappear after the sun shines on them because the water evaporates.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Summary of states of water:**\n* **Solid:** Ice (frozen water)\n* **Liquid:** Water\n* **Gas:** Steam or water vapor\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also make a **simple diagram showing water changing from solid → liquid → gas**, which helps students understand it better.",
    "gemini-2.5": "Hello class! 👋 Today, let's talk about **water** and its amazing ability to change how it looks and feels. We call these different ways that water exists **states of water**.\n\n---\n\n## 🌡️ Boiling Point: Water Turns into Steam (Gas)\nWhen we talk about the temperature 100°C, we are talking about the **boiling point** of water.\n* **What happens?** When you heat liquid water all the way up to 100°C, the tiny water particles (molecules) get a huge amount of energy. They start moving incredibly fast and break away from each other completely.\n* **The State:** The liquid water quickly changes into a **gas** called **steam** or **water vapor**. You can see this as bubbles forming in a pot of water and then floating away into the air.\n* **In Simple Terms:** The water is so excited that it can't stay together as a liquid anymore, so it flies away as invisible steam.\n\n---\n\n## ❄️ Freezing Point: Water Turns into Ice (Solid)\nThe temperature 0°C is the **freezing point** of water.\n* **What happens?** When you cool liquid water down to 0°C, the tiny water particles lose a lot of their energy. They start moving much slower and pack tightly together in a fixed, ordered pattern.\n* **The State:** The liquid water changes into a **solid** state we call **ice**.\n* **In Simple Terms:** The water particles slow down, lock arms, and hold still, turning the runny liquid into a hard, stiff block of ice.\n\n---\n\n## ☀️ Evaporation: Liquid Turns into Vapor (Gas)\n**Evaporation** is how liquid water slowly turns into a gas, even *without* reaching the boiling point (100°C).\n* **What happens?** When the Sun or another heat source warms up liquid water (like a puddle, a lake, or even water in a wet towel), some of the water particles near the surface get enough energy to escape into the air.\n* **The Process:** This is a slow, gradual process where the water disappears into the air as **water vapor** (gas). This is why a wet sidewalk dries up after a while, even if the water never boiled.\n* **In Simple Terms:** The Sun is gently giving the water particles a little push, allowing them to quietly float away into the sky as part of the air. This is how clouds are formed!\n\n---\n\nSo, water can be a **liquid** (like in a glass), a **solid** (like ice), or a **gas** (like steam or vapor). It just depends on the temperature!\n\nDo you have any questions about the three states of water?",
    "claude-3": "# States of Water: A Simple Explanation\n\nHello! Let me teach you about the three states of water in a fun and easy way.\n\n## **Water Freezes at 0°C (Ice)**\nWhen water gets very cold, it changes into ice. Imagine water molecules like tiny people holding hands. When it's cold, they slow down and hold on tightly to each other. They form a hard, solid block called ice. This happens when water reaches 0°C (that's very cold!). You see ice in winter, in freezers, or when you make ice cubes.\n\n**What happens:** Water becomes hard and solid → becomes ice\n\n---\n\n## **Water Boils at 100°C (Steam)**\nWhen water gets very hot, it boils! This means the water molecules move very fast and break apart. They turn into an invisible gas called steam. You can see steam rising from hot water in a pot or cup of tea. This happens when water reaches 100°C (that's very hot!). The steam floats up into the air.\n\n**What happens:** Water becomes hot and bubbly → turns into steam (a gas)\n\n---\n\n## **Water Evaporates When Heated (Gas)**\nEvaporation happens when the sun or heat warms up water. The water molecules get energy and start moving faster. They escape from the water and become invisible gas in the air. This is why wet clothes dry when you hang them in the sun, or why puddles disappear after it rains. You don't see this happening because it's invisible, but it's real!\n\n**What happens:** Water slowly turns into invisible gas and floats away\n\n---\n\n**Remember:** Water can change between solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (steam), depending on how hot or cold it is!"
