    "gemini-2.5": "That's a fantastic idea! A song is a great way to make learning the continents fun and memorable.\n\nHere is a short, catchy song for four students, based on the tune of 'Are You Sleeping, Brother John?' (also known as 'Frère Jacques').\n\n---\n\n## 🌎 The Seven Continents Song 🎶\n\n*(To the tune of 'Are You Sleeping, Brother John?')*\n\n| Student | Lyrics |\n| :---: | :--- |\n| **All** | Continents, continents! |\n| **All** | Let's all learn them now! |\n| **Student 1** | **Asia** is the largest, **Africa** is next! |\n| **Student 2** | Then comes **North America** and **South America**! |\n| **Student 3** | Don't forget **Antarctica**, cold and white and neat! |\n| **Student 4** | **Europe** and **Australia**, now the set's complete! |\n| **All** | Seven continents, seven continents! |\n| **All** | We know all of them now! |\n\n---\n\n### **Teacher's Notes:**\n\n* **Tune:** 'Are You Sleeping, Brother John?' (Simple and well-known)\n* **Action:** Encourage the students to clap or tap their feet in time, and maybe point to a map when they sing their assigned continent names!\n* **Emphasis:** Have the students really **emphasize** the continent names in bold.\n\nWould you like me to write a short, fun activity to go along with this song?",
