    "llama3.2":"The formula you provided is a simple algebraic equation:\n\n15 = x + 2 - 10\n\nTo solve for the variable x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.\n\nStep 1: Combine the constants on the right-hand side of the equation\n- 10 and 2 are both constants, so we can combine them:\n15 = x + (-8)\n\nStep 2: Add 8 to both sides of the equation\n15 + 8 = x + (-8) + 8\n23 = x\n\nAnalysis of the variables:\n* x: This represents an unknown quantity or value.\n* The numbers on the right-hand side of the equation (2 and -10): constants.\n\nFinal solution:\n23 = x â†’ x = 23"
