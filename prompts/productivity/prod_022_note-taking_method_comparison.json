    "gpt-5": "Here’s a structured list of effective note-taking methods for Physics, with descriptions, best use cases, and an evaluation of which suits analytical (theoretical/conceptual) and practical (experiment-based/problem-solving) learning.\n\n### 1. Cornell Method\n**Description:** Page divided into three sections — Notes, Cues/Keywords, and Summary. Notes go in the main area; cues on the left for quick recall; summary at the bottom.\n**When to Use:** During lectures or textbook reading — helps organize key ideas, formulas, and principles clearly.\n**Best for:** Analytical subjects — excellent for conceptual clarity and revision. Practical — less useful during lab work but good for post-lab reflections.\n\n### 2. Mind Mapping\n**Description:** Visual diagrams connecting central concepts with branches for subtopics, formulas, and relationships.\n**When to Use:** While reviewing a topic or connecting multiple concepts.\n**Best for:** Analytical — great for understanding relations between physics laws. Practical — moderately useful for designing experiments conceptually.\n\n### 3. Outline Method\n**Description:** Hierarchical structure with headings, subheadings, and bullet points showing relationships and derivations logically.\n**When to Use:** For taking notes from textbooks, lectures, or derivation-heavy topics.\n**Best for:** Analytical — clear, linear understanding of formulas and steps. Practical — less suited to recording experimental steps or data.\n\n### 4. Flow Notes (Concept Flow Method)\n**Description:** Notes written in a free-flowing, connected way — mixing text, arrows, sketches, and equations to show reasoning flow.\n**When to Use:** During problem-solving sessions or when deriving equations step-by-step.\n**Best for:** Analytical — excellent for reasoning and derivation tracking. Practical — can help in understanding experimental reasoning.\n\n### 5. Charting Method (Tabular Method)\n**Description:** Organizes information into tables — for comparing formulas, physical quantities, or experimental results.\n**When to Use:** While summarizing multiple formulas, comparing laws, or recording lab data.\n**Best for:** Analytical — useful for revision comparisons. Practical — best for organizing experimental data and results.\n\n### 6. Experimental/Lab Journal\n**Description:** Structured records of experiments — including objective, apparatus, procedure, observations, and conclusion.\n**When to Use:** During or immediately after lab sessions.\n**Best for:** Analytical — limited use. Practical — essential for experiment-based learning.\n\n### 7. Equation Summary Sheets\n**Description:** Condensed pages of all formulas with definitions of symbols and conditions of validity.\n**When to Use:** Before exams or while practicing numerical problems.\n**Best for:** Analytical — perfect for quick reference. Practical — helpful in lab analysis or data calculation.\n\n### Evaluation Summary\n| Method          | Analytical (Theory/Concepts) | Practical (Experiments/Applications) |\n| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |\n| Cornell         | ⭐⭐⭐⭐                         | ⭐⭐                                   |\n| Mind Mapping    | ⭐⭐⭐⭐                         | ⭐⭐                                   |\n| Outline         | ⭐⭐⭐⭐                         | ⭐⭐                                   |\n| Flow Notes      | ⭐⭐⭐⭐                         | ⭐⭐⭐                                  |\n| Charting        | ⭐⭐⭐                          | ⭐⭐⭐⭐                                 |\n| Lab Journal     | ⭐⭐                           | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐                                |\n| Equation Sheets | ⭐⭐⭐⭐                         | ⭐⭐⭐                                  |\n\n### Final Recommendation\n* For analytical/theoretical physics: Cornell, Flow Notes, or Outline Method.\n* For practical/experimental physics: Charting + Lab Journal combination.\n* For revision or integration of both: Mind Maps and Equation Sheets work best.",
    
    "gemini-2.5": "The most effective note-taking methods for Physics are those that help you organize formulas, derivations, and the relationships between concepts. The best method often depends on your learning style and the context (lecture or textbook).\n\n## Top Note-Taking Methods for Physics\n| Method | Description | When to Use |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Cornell Method | Divide the page into Notes Column (main content), Cue Column (keywords, questions, formulas), and Summary Section at the bottom. | Analytical subjects. Excellent for lecture notes, active recall, and structured review.\n| Outlining Method | Uses headings, subheadings, and bullet points to create a structured, hierarchical set of notes. | Analytical subjects. Best when the lecture or text is well-organized.\n| Mapping/Mind Map | A visual method where the main topic is in the center, with key concepts branching outwards. | Practical & Analytical. Best for visualizing complex relationships and reviewing chapters.\n| T-Note Method | Two-column method: one side for formulas/equations, the other for description/example of use. | Analytical subjects. Excellent for formula-heavy content.\n| Boxing Method | Key sections or subtopics are separated by boxes. | Practical subjects. Good for grouping related problems or derivations visually.\n\n## Evaluation for Analytical vs. Practical Subjects\n**Analytical Subjects:** Best method — Cornell Method. Organizes dense information, formulas, variables, and key concepts. Summary section reinforces understanding.\n**Practical Subjects:** Best method — T-Note Method. Visual and quick reference for formula and context. Mapping/Mind Map is a strong runner-up for linking concepts to problems.",
