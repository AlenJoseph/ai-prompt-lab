    "gpt-5": "Here are **3 effective ways for a working woman to manage time efficiently**, broken down with what to do, why it helps, and tools/routines to implement, along with a practical example:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Prioritize Tasks with the Eisenhower Matrix\n**What to do:**\n- Categorize tasks into 4 quadrants:\n  1. Urgent & Important – Do immediately\n  2. Important but Not Urgent – Schedule for later\n  3. Urgent but Not Important – Delegate\n  4. Neither Urgent nor Important – Eliminate\n**Why it helps:**\n- Focuses energy on high-impact tasks\n- Reduces stress from last-minute work\n- Helps avoid wasting time on low-priority activities\n**App or routine to implement:**\n- App: Todoist, Notion, or Trello with labels for priority\n- Routine: Start the day by listing tasks and categorizing them\n**Example on a workday:**\n- Morning: Review tasks in Todoist\n- Urgent & Important: Prepare client presentation due today\n- Important but Not Urgent: Schedule time to update your project report\n- Urgent but Not Important: Delegate meeting follow-up emails to your assistant\n- Neither: Skip browsing unnecessary social media\n\n---\n\n### 2. Use Time Blocking\n**What to do:**\n- Allocate specific blocks of time for each type of work\n- Include breaks and buffer time between tasks\n**Why it helps:**\n- Prevents task overlap and multitasking fatigue\n- Creates a visual structure for the day\n- Encourages deep focus and consistent productivity\n**App or routine to implement:**\n- App: Google Calendar, Clockify, or Microsoft Outlook\n- Routine: Schedule all work, personal, and break times the night before\n**Example on a workday:**\n- 9:00–10:30 AM: Focused work on project analysis\n- 10:30–10:45 AM: Short break\n- 10:45–12:00 PM: Client calls and emails\n- 12:00–1:00 PM: Lunch\n- 1:00–3:00 PM: Team meeting and report preparation\n- 3:00–3:15 PM: Coffee break\n- 3:15–5:00 PM: Complete remaining tasks or urgent issues\n\n---\n\n### 3. Apply the Two-Minute Rule for Small Tasks\n**What to do:**\n- If a task can be done in 2 minutes or less, do it immediately\n- Tasks that take longer should be scheduled or delegated\n**Why it helps:**\n- Prevents small tasks from piling up\n- Reduces mental clutter\n- Keeps momentum going during the workday\n**App or routine to implement:**\n- App: Microsoft To Do, Any.do, or a simple sticky note system\n- Routine: Quickly handle small emails, messages, or approvals during short gaps\n**Example on a workday:**\n- 11:15 AM: Respond to a quick client confirmation email (2 minutes)\n- 2:45 PM: Approve a minor leave request in HR system (1 minute)\n- By addressing these immediately, you avoid leaving small tasks lingering at the end of the day\n\n---\n\n✅ Tip: Combine these methods—prioritize tasks, block time for important work, and tackle small tasks immediately—to make every workday more productive without burnout.",
    
    "gemini-2.5": "Hello! As a working woman, I understand the constant juggling act. Time management isn't about doing everything, but about doing the **right** things efficiently.\n\nHere are three effective ways to manage your time, structured for easy implementation:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Prioritize Using the Eisenhower Matrix\n**What to Do:** Categorize all tasks (work and personal) into four quadrants: Urgent/Important (Do First), Important/Not Urgent (Schedule), Urgent/Not Important (Delegate), and Not Urgent/Not Important (Eliminate).\n**Why It Helps:** Stops you from wasting energy on tasks that feel urgent but contribute little to long-term goals.\n**App or Routine to Implement:** Friday Power Hour—spend the last hour of your workday reviewing last week and planning next week's tasks using the four categories.\n**Example on a Workday:**\n- Urgent & Important: Finalizing financial report due 10 AM\n- Important & Not Urgent: Plan next quarter's team strategy\n- Urgent & Not Important: Respond to non-critical group email (delegate)\n- Not Urgent & Not Important: Organize digital photo albums (do later or delete)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Time-Block Your Calendar\n**What to Do:** Schedule specific time blocks for focused work, non-work chores, and free time.\n**Why It Helps:** Creates artificial deadlines, protects focus time, and provides a realistic visual of achievable daily goals.\n**App or Routine to Implement:** Google Calendar or Outlook Calendar with color coding.\n**Example on a Workday:**\n- 7:00 AM: Morning routine & commute\n- 9:00 AM: Deep work on app launch\n- 10:30 AM: Admin: respond to urgent emails\n- 11:00 AM: Team check-in meeting\n- 1:00 PM: Lunch & walk\n- 2:00 PM: Draft marketing proposal\n\n---\n\n## 3. Practice Proactive Task Batching\n**What to Do:** Group similar small tasks and complete them all at once instead of sporadically.\n**Why It Helps:** Reduces context switching, minimizes mental fatigue, and improves efficiency.\n**App or Routine to Implement:** Twice-Daily Email Review, batching household chores.\n**Example on a Workday:**\n- 10:30 AM: Process all emails, pay bills, check project updates\n- 10:45 AM–4:00 PM: Focused work on primary project\n- 4:00 PM: Answer calls, check team chat, write to-do list for tomorrow\n\n---",
    
    "claude-3": "# Time Management Strategies for Working Women\n\n**1. Time Blocking**\n*What to do:* Divide your workday into dedicated blocks of time for specific tasks or types of work. Assign focused periods for deep work, meetings, emails, and personal tasks.\n*Why it helps:* Eliminates decision fatigue and context-switching. By knowing exactly what you're doing and when, you reduce procrastination and interruptions.\n*App or routine to implement:* Google Calendar, Outlook, or Notion to create color-coded blocks. Start with 2-3 hours for your most important task first thing in the morning.\n*Workday example:* 9-11 AM: deep work on quarterly report; 11-12 PM: team meetings; 12-1 PM: lunch & walk; 1-2:30 PM: email/admin; 2:30-3:30 PM: collaborative work/mentoring.\n\n---\n\n**2. The Two-Minute Rule + Priority Matrix**\n*What to do:* Handle tasks under 2 minutes immediately. Categorize others using Eisenhower Matrix.\n*Why it helps:* Prevents small tasks from accumulating, focuses on what moves the needle.\n*App or routine to implement:* Todoist, Microsoft To Do, or spreadsheet to categorize weekly tasks. Spend 10 minutes sorting tasks on Sunday evening or Monday morning.\n*Workday example:* Reply to 3 quick Slack messages immediately; schedule 2 important-but-not-urgent tasks for later; block urgent-and-important client deadline for focused time.\n\n---\n\n**3. Batch Similar Tasks**\n*What to do:* Group similar activities (emails, calls, admin) into designated blocks.\n*Why it helps:* Minimizes mental context switching, allowing momentum and faster task completion.\n*App or routine to implement:* Set email check-ins at 9 AM, 12 PM, 3 PM; cluster meetings; assign a day for admin tasks.\n*Workday example:* Tuesday: collaboration day with meetings; Wednesday: deep work morning; Thursday afternoon: batch admin tasks."
