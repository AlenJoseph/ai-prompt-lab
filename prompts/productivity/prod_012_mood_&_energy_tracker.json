    "gpt-5": "Here’s a sample Daily Mood & Energy Tracker for the past week, followed by an analysis and personalized productivity tips based on the observed patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Daily Mood & Energy Tracking Table\n\n| Date (2025)  | Mood         | Energy Level (0–9) | Productivity Score (0–10) | Notes                                    |\n| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| Nov 6 (Thu)  | Positive     | 8                  | 9                         | Focused, completed key tasks early.      |\n| Nov 7 (Fri)  | Neutral      | 6                  | 6                         | Slight fatigue, distracted in afternoon. |\n| Nov 8 (Sat)  | Happy        | 7                  | 8                         | Productive morning, relaxed evening.     |\n| Nov 9 (Sun)  | Calm         | 5                  | 5                         | Low motivation, slow-paced.              |\n| Nov 10 (Mon) | Low          | 4                  | 4                         | Sleep-deprived, hard to concentrate.     |\n| Nov 11 (Tue) | Motivated    | 8                  | 9                         | Good sleep, strong focus sessions.       |\n| Nov 12 (Wed) | Balanced     | 7                  | 8                         | Consistent focus, maintained workflow.   |\n\n---\n\n### Pattern Analysis\n\n* Energy Peaks: Thursdays and Tuesdays show high energy (8–9). → Most productive at the start and just after the weekend reset.\n* Energy Dips: Sundays and Mondays show low energy (4–5). → Possibly due to weekend fatigue or irregular sleep schedule.\n* Mood–Productivity Correlation: Positive mood days = higher productivity (8–9). → Emotional well-being directly impacts focus and output.\n* Sleep & Rest Factor: Lowest productivity coincides with poor sleep. → Consistent rest is key to sustaining performance.\n\n---\n\n### Tips to Improve Daily Productivity\n\n1. Stabilize Sleep Schedule: Aim for 7–8 hours nightly.\n2. Morning Activation Routine: Short workout, cold splash, or sunlight exposure.\n3. Midweek Reset (Wednesday): Light reflection or planning sessions.\n4. Batch Creative Work on High-Energy Days: Reserve deep work for Thursdays and Tuesdays.\n5. Use Sundays for Light Planning: Spend 30 mins organizing the week ahead.\n6. Track Triggers: Note factors (diet, stress, interactions) that influence mood drops.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to generate a chart (energy vs productivity trend) for this week’s data?",
    "gemini-2.5": "This is a great exercise for self-awareness! Since I cannot access your actual personal data, I will provide a sample log of daily mood and energy over the past week, followed by an analysis and suggested productivity tips based on the pattern in the sample data.\n\n## Daily Mood and Energy Tracker (Sample Week)\n\n| Date | Mood           | Energy Level (0–9) | Productivity Score |\n| :--- | :------------ | :---------------- | :---------------- |\n| Mon  | Neutral/Stressed | 5 | 6 |\n| Tue  | Focused/Positive | 7 | 8 |\n| Wed  | Slightly Tired   | 6 | 7 |\n| Thu  | Anxious/Busy     | 4 | 5 |\n| Fri  | Happy/Motivated  | 8 | 9 |\n| Sat  | Relaxed/Calm     | 7 | 3 |\n| Sun  | Reflective/Mild Stress | 5 | 4 |\n\n---\n\n## Analysis of Data Pattern\n\n1. Mid-Week Dip: Energy (4–5) and Productivity (5–6) drop noticeably on Thursday and Monday, correlating with moods like 'Stressed' and 'Anxious'.\n2. Peak Performance: Tuesday and Friday show the highest Energy (7–8) and Productivity (8–9).\n3. Weekend Discrepancy: Saturday shows high Energy (7) but low Productivity (3), likely due to focus shifting from work to rest.\n\n---\n\n## Tips to Improve Daily Productivity\n\n1. Strategically Schedule High-Priority Work on peak days (Tuesday, Friday).\n2. Mitigate the Mid-Week Dip with short breaks and time-blocking.\n3. Maximize Sunday for light planning to reduce Monday anxiety.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to create a blank tracking template for your next week?",
