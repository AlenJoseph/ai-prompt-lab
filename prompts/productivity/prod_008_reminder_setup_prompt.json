    "claude-3": "I appreciate you wanting to set a reminder, but I should let you know that I don't have the ability to set reminders directly. I can't access your calendar, task management apps, or device settings.\n\nHowever, I can help you create a structured reminder that you can easily enter into whatever system you use. Here are the details:\n\n**Task description:** Submit the project report\n\n**Date and time:** November 15, 2025, at 5:00 PM\n\n**Priority level:** High (since project submissions are typically time-sensitive)\n\n**Reminder message:** 'Don't forget to submit the project report by 5:00 PM today!'\n\nTo actually set this reminder, you can:\n- Use your phone's built-in reminders or alarm app\n- Add it to a calendar app like Google Calendar, Outlook, or Apple Calendar\n- Use a task management tool like Todoist, Microsoft To Do, Asana, or Notion\n- Set it in your email client's task feature\n\nMost of these tools allow you to set notifications in advance (like 30 minutes or 1 hour before) so you have time to wrap up and submit the report. Would you like help formatting this information for a specific app or service?"
