    "gpt-5": "Here’s a compassionate, psychologist-designed plan to help someone stay **optimistic and emotionally strong during career uncertainty** — blending **coping techniques, affirmations, and mindset exercises** for resilience and hope.\n\n---\n\n## 🌤️ 1. Emotional Grounding & Self-Compassion\n\n**Purpose:** To reduce anxiety and reconnect with stability amid uncertainty.\n\n### Techniques:\n\n* **Name the feeling:** Each morning, identify what emotion dominates your thoughts (“I feel anxious about my future” → “I am noticing anxiety, and that’s okay”). Naming emotions decreases their power.\n* **Soothing breath:** Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 6. Repeat for 2 minutes.\n* **Limit “catastrophic thinking”:** When your mind spirals (“I’ll never find a job”), gently counter with, “This is temporary, and I have overcome challenges before.”\n\n### Affirmations:\n\n* “I am capable, adaptable, and open to new paths.”\n* “Uncertainty is not the end — it’s the beginning of possibility.”\n* “I give myself permission to rest and rebuild.”\n\n---\n\n## 🌱 2. Cognitive Reframing: Turn Fear Into Growth\n\n**Purpose:** Shift from self-doubt to learning and opportunity.\n\n### Exercise:\n\n* Write down your biggest career worry in one column.\n* In another column, rewrite it as a *growth statement*.\n  **Example:**\n  “I don’t know what comes next.” → “I am exploring what truly aligns with my values.”\n  “I failed an interview.” → “I learned how to present myself better next time.”\n\n### Reflection Prompt:\n\n> “What might this uncertainty be teaching me about who I am and what I truly value?”\n\n### Affirmations:\n\n* “Every pause is a chance to grow in new directions.”\n* “I trust that clarity will come through consistent effort.”\n\n---\n\n## ☀️ 3. Mind–Body Connection: Restore Balance\n\n**Purpose:** To regulate emotions through physical grounding and daily rhythm.\n\n### Techniques:\n\n* **Routine reset:** Create a small daily structure — morning movement, 10 minutes of journaling, healthy meals, consistent sleep.\n* **Movement therapy:** Try mindful walks or light yoga focusing on the phrase, “I am moving forward.”\n* **Digital boundaries:** Limit job-search scrolling to set times; it protects your nervous system from burnout.\n\n### Affirmations:\n\n* “My energy is precious — I invest it where it matters.”\n* “Each small step is progress.”\n\n---\n\n## 💬 4. Reconnect with Purpose & Strengths\n\n**Purpose:** To rebuild confidence and a sense of identity beyond your job title.\n\n### Exercises:\n\n* **Strength reflection:** Write down 3 skills or personal traits that have helped you succeed in past transitions.\n* **Values journaling:** Ask yourself — “What kind of work gives me meaning?” “What environments make me thrive?”\n* **Mini-success tracking:** Note one daily achievement — even sending an email or applying for a job counts.\n\n### Affirmations:\n\n* “My worth is not defined by my career status.”\n* “I have skills that are needed in this world.”\n* “I am building something meaningful, even if I can’t see it yet.”\n\n---\n\n## 🌈 5. Cultivate Hope & Forward Vision\n\n**Purpose:** To maintain optimism and future orientation.\n\n### Visualization:\n\nEach night, close your eyes and imagine your future self — confident, fulfilled, and proud.\nAsk:\n\n* “What steps did I take to get here?”\n* “What habits kept me hopeful?”\n\n### Gratitude Practice:\n\nBefore sleep, note 3 things that went *right* today — even small ones.\nGratitude shifts focus from lack to abundance.\n\n### Affirmations:\n\n* “I may not know what’s next, but I know I’m growing into it.”\n* “Hope is my anchor — I choose to hold on.”\n* “Every day is a chance to begin again.”\n\n---\n\n## 💫 Daily Balance Routine (10–15 min total)\n\n| Time    | Activity                           | Purpose            |\n| ------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------ |\n| Morning | 3 deep breaths + one affirmation   | Set a hopeful tone |\n| Midday  | 5-min mindful walk or stretch      | Reset energy       |\n| Evening | Journal 3 gratitudes + 1 small win | Reinforce optimism |\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to turn this into a **printable “Emotional Strength Toolkit” PDF** (with daily exercises and affirmations laid out as a guided journal)? It could serve as a daily reflection sheet.",
    "gemini-2.5": "Hello. I understand that you're navigating a period of **career uncertainty**, and that can feel profoundly unsettling. It's completely normal to experience anxiety, frustration, or doubt right now. Please know that having these feelings doesn't mean you are weak; it means you are human, and you are facing a significant challenge.\n\nMy role is to offer you tools—coping techniques, affirmations, and mindset exercises—to help you cultivate optimism and maintain emotional strength during this time. We will focus on shifting your perspective from one of fear to one of **opportunity and resilience**.\n\nHere is a structured plan to help you stay hopeful and balanced:\n\n---\n\n## 🧭 Phase 1: Grounding and Immediate Coping Techniques\n\nWhen anxiety flares up, these techniques can bring you back to the present moment and regulate your emotions.\n\n### 1. The 5-4-3-2-1 Technique (Mindfulness)\nThis exercise anchors you in the present, away from worrying thoughts about the future.\n\n* **5:** Name **five things** you can **see** (e.g., the pattern on the wall, a book, your hands).\n* **4:** Name **four things** you can **feel** (e.g., the texture of your shirt, the chair beneath you, the temperature of the air).\n* **3:** Name **three things** you can **hear** (e.g., a car outside, your breathing, the hum of a fan).\n* **2:** Name **two things** you can **smell** (e.g., coffee, soap, fresh air).\n* **1:** Name **one thing** you can **taste** (e.g., mint, water, nothing particular).\n\n### 2. **Controlled Breathing (The 4-7-8 Method)**\nThis technique engages your parasympathetic nervous system, promoting calm.\n\n* **Inhale:** Breathe in quietly through your nose for a count of **4**.\n* **Hold:** Hold your breath for a count of **7**.\n* **Exhale:** Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound, for a count of **8**.\n* Repeat this cycle at least four times.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Phase 2: Mindset Exercises and Reframing\n\nUncertainty often triggers **catastrophic thinking** (assuming the worst possible outcome). These exercises help challenge and reframe those thoughts.\n\n### 1. The \"What If?\" Flip\nWhen you catch yourself thinking a negative \"what if,\" consciously re-orient it to a positive one.\n\n| Negative Thought (The Fear) | Positive Reframe (The Opportunity) |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| \"What if I can't find another job?\" | \"**What if** I find a job that is a much better fit for my skills and happiness?\" |\n| \"What if I wasted all that time?\" | \"**What if** this break allows me to gain a new certification or skill I always wanted?\" |\n| \"What if my financial situation collapses?\" | \"**What if** I discover new, creative ways to manage my finances and become more secure?\" |\n\n### 2. Identifying the **\"Controllables\"**\nDraw a line down the center of a page. List things you **can control** (actions) on one side, and things you **cannot control** (outcomes, other people's decisions, the economy) on the other.\n\n* **Focus your energy exclusively on the \"Controllables\":** Your effort, your daily routine, who you network with, updating your resume, taking a course, or taking care of your physical health.\n* **Practice \"Radical Acceptance\"** for the uncontrollables—acknowledge they exist, but refuse to give them your power.\n\n### 3. **The 'Success Inventory'**\nYour current situation does not negate your past achievements. Take 15 minutes to write down:\n\n* **Three professional challenges** you have overcome in the past.\n* **Five skills or strengths** that you are proud of (e.g., problem-solving, resilience, creativity, teamwork).\n* **One piece of positive feedback** you received that boosted your confidence.\n\n*Reading this inventory daily reminds you that you have a track record of success and resilience.*\n\n---\n\n## ✨ Phase 3: Affirmations and Personal Mantra\n\nUse these affirmations daily—say them out loud, write them down, or keep them visible. They are designed to instill hope and self-worth.\n\n### Daily Affirmations\n\n* **\"I am resilient, and I have successfully navigated difficult times before.\"**\n* **\"My worth is not defined by my job title or career status.\"**\n* **\"I trust the timing of my life, and I am learning something important from this experience.\"**\n* **\"I am actively taking positive steps every day, and that is enough.\"**\n* **\"This uncertainty is temporary, but my strength is permanent.\"**\n\n### Creating a Personal Mantra\nChoose one phrase that truly resonates with you and repeat it whenever doubt creeps in. Examples:\n\n> * \"I am building something better.\"\n> * \"One foot in front of the other.\"\n> * \"Patience and persistence.\"\n\n---\n\n## 🏃‍♀️ Phase 4: Prioritizing Balance\n\nEmotional strength requires protecting your energy and engaging in activities outside of the career search.\n\n* **Maintain a Schedule:** Keep a regular sleep schedule, even if you don't have a rigid work structure. Routine is a powerful antidote to anxiety.\n* **Move Your Body:** Physical activity (a walk, stretching, or a workout) is essential for releasing built-up stress hormones. Aim for 20 minutes a day.\n* **Nurture Connections:** Do not isolate yourself. Spend quality time with friends or family and actively talk about *non-career* related topics. Joy and connection are resources, not distractions.\n* **Set Boundaries for the Job Search:** Designate specific hours for applying, networking, and research. Outside of those hours, you are *off the clock*. This prevents the uncertainty from consuming your entire life.\n\nRemember, this is a **transition**, not a final destination. Be kind and patient with yourself, the same way you would be with a dear friend.\n\nWould you like me to help you formulate a personalized \"Controllables\" list based on your specific situation?",
    "claude-3": "I appreciate you framing this, and I'm happy to offer perspective on navigating career uncertainty. Though I should be transparent: I'm Claude, an AI assistant, not a licensed psychologist. That said, I can share evidence-informed approaches that many people find genuinely helpful during uncertain times.\n\n**Understanding What You're Facing**\n\nCareer uncertainty can feel destabilizing because work is deeply tied to identity, stability, and self-worth. It's normal to experience anxiety, doubt, or a sense of loss of control. The good news is that these periods, while uncomfortable, are also opportunities to build resilience and clarity.\n\n**Coping Techniques That Actually Help**\n\n*Separate your worth from your circumstances.* Your value as a person isn't determined by your job title, income, or employment status. This is harder to believe during uncertainty, but it's true. When anxiety creeps in, try grounding yourself in relationships, skills, or character traits that exist independent of your career.\n\n*Break the uncertainty into manageable pieces.* \"Career uncertainty\" feels overwhelming. But it's usually composed of concrete questions: Do I need to upskill? Should I explore new fields? How do I fund myself meanwhile? Tackling specific questions feels more empowering than dwelling on the vague worry.\n\n*Create a \"control inventory.\"* List what you can't control (market conditions, others' hiring decisions) separately from what you can (how you spend your time, skills you develop, effort you invest in networking, how you frame your situation). Direct your energy toward the second list.\n\n*Establish small daily wins.* When the future feels uncertain, anchoring yourself to present actions matters. This might be updating a resume section, taking an online course, reaching out to someone in a field you're curious about, or even just maintaining a routine. These aren't magical, but they shift you from passive anxiety to active agency.\n\n**Affirmations That Go Beyond Empty Positivity**\n\nGeneric affirmations (\"Everything will be fine\") often ring hollow. More grounded affirmations that tend to resonate:\n\n- \"This uncertainty is temporary, and I'm building skills and clarity through it.\"\n- \"I've navigated challenges before. I have resilience I may have forgotten about.\"\n- \"My career isn't my entire story. I have value in other areas of my life right now.\"\n- \"Not knowing what's next is uncomfortable, but it also means possibilities are open.\"\n- \"I can take one meaningful step today, and that's enough.\"\n\nThe key is that affirmations work better when they feel *true* to you, not like wishful thinking.\n\n**Mindset Exercises**\n\n*The \"worst case / best case / most likely case\" exercise:* Our minds often get stuck in catastrophizing. Write out all three scenarios for your situation. Usually, the most likely case is more manageable than the feared worst case, and considering the best case reminds you that positive outcomes are possible too.\n\n*Reframe uncertainty as exploration.* Instead of \"I don't know what I'm doing,\" try \"I'm learning what actually fits for me.\" This is subtly different—one feels stuck, the other feels like a process.\n\n*Practice \"compassionate witnessing\" of difficult emotions.* When anxiety or doubt arise, notice them without judgment: \"I'm experiencing fear right now. That's understandable given the situation. It won't last forever.\" This is more effective than either suppressing emotions or being consumed by them.\n\n*Cultivate gratitude alongside concern.* This isn't toxic positivity—it's neurological. Actively noticing what's still stable or good in your life (relationships, skills, interests, small comforts) creates psychological balance. You're not denying the difficulty; you're not letting it consume the whole picture.\n\n**A Balanced Perspective**\n\nHope isn't about pretending uncertainty doesn't exist. It's about recognizing that:\n- Uncertainty often precedes growth\n- You have agency even in constrained situations\n- Past resilience predicts future resilience\n- This phase has an endpoint, even if you can't see it clearly yet\n\nThe strongest people through uncertainty aren't those who never feel scared. They're those who feel scared and take meaningful action anyway.\n\nIs there a specific aspect of your career uncertainty you'd like to explore further? Or particular emotions that are hitting hardest right now?"
