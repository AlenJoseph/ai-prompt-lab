    "gemini-2.5": "That's a fantastic, detailed plan! Let's simplify and turbocharge it into a short, friendly, and actionable guide.\n\nHere is the rewritten productivity plan:\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 The Remote Team Power Plan\n\nLet's cut the noise, focus on the mission, and build stronger connections. This plan is all about giving you the **time** to do great work and the **support** to do it smoothly.\n\n### 1. **Protect Your Focus: 'Deep Work Time'**\n\n**Goal:** Crush your hardest tasks without interruptions.\n\n| Action | How It Works |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Schedule 90-120 Min Blocks** | Designate 2 mandatory \"Focus Blocks\" daily. |\n| **Silence Everything** | Set your status to **\"DND - Focus Block\"**. Only interrupt for a true emergency. |\n| **The 30-Second Report** | When the block ends, quickly post your progress in a designated channel: **Goal → Outcome → Next Step.** |\n\n**Mantra:** *Less Pings, More Progress!*\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Find It Fast: 'Wiki-First' Knowledge**\n\n**Goal:** Stop wasting time asking questions and get instant answers.\n\n| Action | How It Works |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Build Your Hub** | Create one central, searchable wiki (Notion, Confluence, etc.) for all processes and answers. |\n| **Document on Demand** | If a question is asked twice, the answer *must* be immediately added to the wiki. |\n| **Enforce the Rule** | When someone asks a question, reply with the wiki link: **\"Great question, it's right here! → [Link]\"** |\n\n**Mantra:** *Document today, Save hours tomorrow!*\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Connect & Recharge: 'Casual Crew Time'**\n\n**Goal:** Boost team trust and morale with zero pressure.\n\n| Action | How It Works |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Schedule Optional Hangouts** | Add 2 non-mandatory, 15-minute \"Coffee Break\" calls to the calendar per week. |\n| **Strictly Non-Work** | The only rule: **NO TALK ABOUT WORK.** Keep it light (pets, food, weekend plans, etc.). |\n| **Use Icebreakers** | Use a fun opener to kick things off. Keep the atmosphere relaxed and friendly. |\n\n**Mantra:** *Stronger Bonds → Better Collaboration!*\n\n---\n\nI recommend we start with **Deep Work Time (Action 1)**. It will have the fastest, most measurable impact on output.\n\nWould you like a short, motivational email draft to introduce this new \"Deep Work Time\" concept to your team?",
    "claude-3": "# Simple Remote Team Productivity Plan\n\n## 🎯 Your 3 Keys to Better Productivity\n\nPick one to start with. You've got this!\n\n---\n\n## 1️⃣ Focused Work Blocks\n\n**What:** Quiet time blocks where interruptions are off-limits.\n\n**How:**\n- Pick 2 times per day for 90–120 minute \"focus blocks\" (e.g., 9:30–11 AM, 2–3:30 PM)\n- Set your status to \"Do Not Disturb\" — no Slack, emails, or calls unless it's an emergency\n- After the block, post a quick win: \"Goal: X.
