    "gpt-5": "Here’s a **7-day Python Programming Skill Improvement Plan** designed to build consistency, deepen understanding, and track progress through reflection.\n\n---\n\n## 🗓 **Weekly Python Learning Plan**\n\n### **Day 1 – Strengthen the Foundations**\n**Goal:** Reinforce basic syntax and key Python concepts\n**Activity:**\n- Review data types (strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)\n- Practice writing 5 small scripts using loops and conditionals\n**Duration:** 1.5 hours\n**Tip:** Don’t just read—type out every example to build muscle memory.\n**Reflection:** What concepts still feel unclear? Can you explain data types in your own words?\n\n---\n\n### **Day 2 – Functions & Modular Code**\n**Goal:** Write clean, reusable functions\n**Activity:**\n- Learn about parameters, return values, and variable scope\n- Refactor a script from Day 1 into modular functions\n**Duration:** 1.5 hours\n**Tip:** Think of each function as a “mini-tool” that does one clear job.\n**Reflection:** Did modularizing your code make it easier to read and test?\n\n---\n\n### **Day 3 – Data Structures in Depth**\n**Goal:** Practice using lists, dictionaries, and sets for problem-solving\n**Activity:**\n- Solve 3–5 coding challenges (e.g., from LeetCode, HackerRank) involving nested data structures\n- Learn about list comprehensions and dictionary methods\n**Duration:** 2 hours\n**Tip:** Focus on writing concise, readable code rather than complex one-liners.\n**Reflection:** Which data structure did you find most powerful today—and why?\n\n---\n\n### **Day 4 – File Handling & Exceptions**\n**Goal:** Learn to interact with files and handle errors gracefully\n**Activity:**\n- Practice reading/writing `.txt` and `.csv` files\n- Use `try...except` blocks to handle possible file errors\n**Duration:** 1.5 hours\n**Tip:** Always close files or use `with open()` to avoid resource leaks.\n**Reflection:** How did exception handling improve your program’s stability?\n\n---\n\n### **Day 5 – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**\n**Goal:** Understand and apply classes, objects, and inheritance\n**Activity:**\n- Build a small class (e.g., `Car` or `Student`) with attributes and methods\n- Add inheritance (e.g., `ElectricCar` subclass)\n**Duration:** 2 hours\n**Tip:** Focus on “real-world modeling” — imagine how your class represents a real object.\n**Reflection:** How does OOP make large programs easier to manage?\n\n---\n\n### **Day 6 – Working with Libraries & APIs**\n**Goal:** Learn to use Python’s ecosystem effectively\n**Activity:**\n- Explore popular libraries like `requests`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`\n- Fetch data from an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and visualize it\n**Duration:** 2 hours\n**Tip:** Read library docs briefly before coding—it saves time later.\n**Reflection:** Which library felt most useful for your future projects?\n\n---\n\n### **Day 7 – Mini Project & Review**\n**Goal:** Apply everything learned throughout the week\n**Activity:**\n- Build a small project (choose one):\n  - Expense tracker using file storage\n  - Weather app using API\n  - Student score analyzer using pandas\n- Review notes from the week\n**Duration:** 2.5 hours\n**Tip:** Focus on completing the project, not perfection. Iteration brings improvement.\n**Reflection:**\n- What did you enjoy most this week?\n- What will you focus on improving next week?\n- Rate your confidence in Python (1–10) and note why.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to create a **second-week continuation plan** (intermediate-level topics like decorators, virtual environments, and async programming)?",
    "gemini-2.5": "Weekly Python Skill Improvement Plan\n\nThis plan is structured to move from Python fundamentals to intermediate concepts (OOP, generators, decorators) and culminates in a practical project application.\n\nDay | Goal | Activity | Duration | Tip\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n**Day 1** | Fundamentals & Data Structure Mastery | Review core data types (Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, Sets). Practice List Comprehensions and Dictionary methods (.get(), .keys(), .values()). Solve 3 easy coding challenges using these structures. | 2 hours | Try to write any for loop that creates a list using a single line of list comprehension instead. It's cleaner and more \"Pythonic.\" \n**Day 2** | Control Flow, Loops & Functions | Master conditional logic (if/elif/else) and looping (for, while). Focus on defining custom functions, parameter passing (including default values), and understanding *args and **kwargs. | 2.5 hours | Aim for functions that perform only one specific task (Single Responsibility Principle). This makes testing and debugging much easier.\n**Day 3** | Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) | Learn the concepts of Classes, Objects, Attributes, and Methods. Create a simple Animal or Car class with a constructor (__init__) and 2-3 custom methods (e.g., make_sound(), drive()). | 3 hours | The self parameter refers to the instance of the object. Think of it as how the object refers to itself inside its own methods.\n**Day 4** | Advanced OOP: Inheritance & Polymorphism | Implement Inheritance by creating 2-3 subclasses (e.g., Dog and Cat inheriting from Animal). Override a method in a subclass (Polymorphism). Learn about the super() function. | 3 hours | Focus on the \"is-a\" relationship: A Dog is a type of Animal. Use isinstance() to check object types for deeper understanding.\n**Day 5** | Error Handling & File I/O | Learn how to handle runtime errors using try, except, and optionally finally. Practice reading from and writing to a text file (.txt). Explore using the with open(...) context manager. | 2 hours | Always use the with open(...) statement for file operations. It guarantees the file is properly closed, even if errors occur.\n**Day 6** | Advanced Concepts: Generators & Decorators | Study generators (functions using yield) for memory-efficient iteration. Learn about decorators (@my_decorator) as a way to modify or enhance a function without changing its source code. | 2.5 hours | Try writing a simple decorator that measures and prints the execution time of any function it wraps.\n**Day 7** | Mini-Project Application & Documentation | Apply everything learned by building a small command-line script (e.g., a Contact Book that uses a dictionary to store data and saves/loads it from a file). Write Docstrings for all classes and functions (PEP 257). | 4 hours | Don't reinvent the wheel—use the json module to save and load your dictionary data easily!\n\n**Reflection and Self-Assessment Summary**\n\n1. **Accomplishments:**\n   - Which daily goals did you meet successfully?\n   - What is the most \"Pythonic\" code snippet you wrote this week?\n\n2. **Challenges:**\n   - What concept did you struggle with the most (e.g., super(), generator logic)?\n   - Which activity took significantly longer than expected?\n\n3. **Next Steps:**\n   - What topic should you review first next week?\n   - Identify one new area to explore next (e.g., requests, pandas, or pytest).",
    "claude-3": "# Weekly Python Programming Learning Plan\n\n## Monday: Foundation Review & Variables\n**Goal:** Refresh understanding of Python basics and master variable handling\n**Activity:** Review Python syntax fundamentals, explore different data types (int, float, str, bool), and practice variable naming conventions. Create a mini-project that demonstrates variable usage across different types.\n**Duration:** 60 minutes\n**Tip:** Use interactive Python shells like REPL or Jupyter Notebooks to experiment with variables in real-time. Try to deliberately break things to understand error messages better.\n\n---\n\n## Tuesday: Control Flow Mastery\n**Goal:** Build strong skills with conditional statements and loops\n**Activity:** Complete exercises on if/elif/else statements, while loops, and for loops. Build a program that uses nested loops (like creating number patterns or a simple game). Practice writing clean, readable code with proper indentation.\n**Duration:** 75 minutes\n**Tip:** Draw flowcharts before writing code to visualize the logic flow.\n\n---\n\n## Wednesday: Functions & Modularity\n**Goal:** Learn to write reusable, well-organized code through functions\n**Activity:** Practice defining functions with various parameter types (positional, default, *args, **kwargs). Refactor previous day's code into functions. Create a utility module with 5-7 related functions and learn basic documentation with docstrings.\n**Duration:** 80 minutes\n**Tip:** Follow the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). If you write similar code twice, it should probably be a function.\n\n---\n\n## Thursday: Working with Data Structures\n**Goal:** Master lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets for efficient data handling\n**Activity:** Practice list operations, dictionary manipulation, set operations, and list comprehensions. Build a data processing program using multiple data structures together.\n**Duration:** 90 minutes\n**Tip:** Understand when to use each structure. Lists are ordered, dictionaries store key-value pairs, sets are unique, and tuples are immutable.\n\n---\n\n## Friday: File Handling & Exception Management\n**Goal:** Learn to read, write, and handle errors gracefully\n**Activity:** Practice reading and writing files (CSV, TXT, JSON). Implement try-except-else-finally blocks. Create a program that reads data, processes it, and writes results.\n**Duration:** 85 minutes\n**Tip:** Use context managers (`with` statement) when working with files.\n\n---\n\n## Saturday: Object-Oriented Programming Basics\n**Goal:** Understand classes, objects, and OOP principles\n**Activity:** Create simple classes with attributes and methods. Practice initialization with __init__, instance methods, and the self parameter.\n**Duration:** 100 minutes\n**Tip:** Start simple and focus on clear relationships between data (attributes) and behaviors (methods).\n\n---\n\n## Sunday: Integration Project & Reflection\n**Goal:** Consolidate the week's learning through a practical application\n**Activity:** Build a project combining multiple concepts: data structures, functions, file handling, and OOP.\n**Duration:** 120 minutes\n**Tip:** Start with pseudocode and break the project into manageable parts.\n\n---\n\n## Weekly Self-Assessment & Reflection\n**Knowledge Assessment:** Which concepts felt most comfortable? Which need more practice?\n**Skill Development:** Were you able to apply multiple concepts in your projects?\n**Progress Notes:** What was the most valuable learning moment this week?\n**Next Steps:** Plan to revisit difficult topics and identify an advanced topic to explore next (e.g., decorators, generators, or libraries)."
