    "gpt-5": "Absolutely! Here’s a structured 3-hour study plan for an engineering student preparing for an exam, using fixed intervals with breaks and revision steps. You can swap topics as needed.\n\n---\n\n### 3-Hour Study Plan (Fixed Interval Method)\n\n**Total time:** 3 hours (180 minutes)\n**Study intervals:** 50 minutes study + 10 minutes break × 3\n**Revision:** Last 20 minutes\n\n---\n\n#### 0:00 – 0:50 (Session 1)\n* **Focus:** Topic 1 (Core Concepts / Theory)\n* **Activity:**\n  - Read textbook or lecture notes\n  - Make concise notes or diagrams\n  - Solve 2–3 example problems\n\n**0:50 – 1:00 | Break**\n- Stretch, hydrate, relax your eyes\n- Avoid phone/social media\n\n---\n\n#### 1:00 – 1:50 (Session 2)\n* **Focus:** Topic 2 (Problem-Solving / Numerical Questions)\n* **Activity:**\n  - Practice past questions or exercises\n  - Focus on areas where mistakes happen\n  - Summarize key formulas and steps\n\n**1:50 – 2:00 | Break**\n- Light snack or walk\n- Deep breathing to refresh\n\n---\n\n#### 2:00 – 2:50 (Session 3)\n* **Focus:** Topic 3 (Applications / Tough Topics)\n* **Activity:**\n  - Revise tough concepts from previous topics\n  - Attempt quick problem-solving exercises\n  - Highlight common pitfalls\n\n**2:50 – 3:00 | Short Break**\n- Quick refresh before final revision\n\n---\n\n#### 3:00 – 3:20 (Revision Session)\n* **Activity:**\n  - Go through concise notes or formula sheet\n  - Attempt 1–2 practice questions from each topic\n  - Summarize key points in 5–10 bullet notes\n\n---\n\n✅ **Tips for Maximum Efficiency:**\n1. Use active recall: Quiz yourself rather than just reading.\n2. Highlight formulas/concepts for quick last-minute review.\n3. Stay focused: No multitasking during study intervals.\n4. Time yourself: Stick strictly to the 50/10 schedule.",
    
    "gemini-2.5": "3-Hour Engineering Exam Study Plan: Deep Work Session\n\nThis schedule is designed to maximize focused learning and short-term memory consolidation over a 180-minute period. It assumes a technical subject like Electrical Circuits, Thermodynamics, or Programming Concepts.\n\n**1. Focused Study Intervals (45-Minute Cycles)**\n\n| Time Slot | Duration | Activity & Focus Area | Study Method |\n|-----------|----------|---------------------|--------------|\n| 0:00 - 0:45 | 45 min | Deep Dive (Topic 1): Core Theory Review (e.g., KVL/KCL, First Law of Thermo, Object-Oriented Principles) | Read notes/textbook summary; Create summary map/flowchart; Understand key terminology |\n| 0:45 - 0:55 | 10 min | Break 1: Mental Reset | Hydrate, stretch, avoid screens |\n| 0:55 - 1:40 | 45 min | Deep Dive (Topic 2): Application & Formulas | Derive formulas; Review example applications; Focus on conditions for each formula |\n| 1:40 - 1:50 | 10 min | Break 2: Active Recall Prep | Glance at syllabus; Mentally prepare for problem-solving |\n| 1:50 - 2:35 | 45 min | Focused Practice & Problem Solving | Solve 3–5 typical exam questions; Time yourself |\n\n**2. Final Revision and Consolidation (25 Minutes)**\n\n| Time Slot | Duration | Revision Step | Focus |\n|-----------|----------|---------------|-------|\n| 2:35 - 3:00 | 25 min | Final High-Intensity Review | 5-minute brain dump; Compare with notes; Targeted formula review; Identify weakest concept for next session |",
    
    "claude-3": "# 3-Hour Exam Study Plan\n\nHere's a structured study plan that balances focused learning with strategic breaks:\n\n## Hour 1: Core Concepts & Active Learning (0:00–1:00)\n- **0:00–0:45 | Study Topic 1** — Focus on challenging or foundational material. Use active recall: read notes, then write down key points from memory.\n- **0:45–1:00 | Break** — Step away from desk, hydrate, stretch, or take a short walk.\n\n## Hour 2: Diverse Topics & Problem-Solving (1:00–2:00)\n- **1:00–1:45 | Study Topic 2** — Switch to a different concept area. Solve practice problems or derivations.\n- **1:45–2:00 | Break** — Mental reset; avoid screens.\n\n## Hour 3: Integration & Focused Revision (2:00–3:00)\n- **2:00–2:30 | Practice Questions & Mixed Review** — Past exam questions requiring multiple topics.\n- **2:30–2:50 | Targeted Revision** — Review concepts you struggled with.\n- **2:50–3:00 | Final Summary & Mental Prep** — Review a one-page summary or mind map of key concepts.\n\n**Key Tips:** Breaks are essential for consolidation. Prioritize understanding first, then practice problems. Note difficult concepts for the revision phase."
