    "gpt-5": "Absolutely! Let’s break this down step by step across the four categories you mentioned: **mindset changes, daily habits, environment setup, and motivation tips**. Here are **5 actionable ways** to stop procrastination:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Shift Your Mindset: Break the “All-or-Nothing” Thinking**\n* **Step-by-step reasoning:** Often we procrastinate because a task feels too big or overwhelming. Thinking “I must do this perfectly” can freeze action.\n* **Actionable tip:** Reframe your mindset to focus on **progress, not perfection**. Tell yourself, “I’ll start with 10 minutes” instead of “I must finish this perfectly.”\n* **Example:** If you need to write a report, start with just the introduction or an outline.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Build Daily Habits: Use Time Blocks & Microtasks**\n* **Step-by-step reasoning:** Procrastination thrives when tasks seem unstructured or endless. Breaking them into smaller chunks makes them more approachable.\n* **Actionable tip:** Adopt **time-blocking**: dedicate 25–50 minute focused sessions (Pomodoro technique) with short breaks.\n* **Example:** Instead of “study 3 hours,” do 6 sessions of 25 minutes with 5-minute breaks.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Optimize Your Environment: Minimize Distractions**\n* **Step-by-step reasoning:** External distractions, like your phone or social media, trigger procrastination.\n* **Actionable tip:** Create a **workspace that signals focus**. Remove unnecessary items, silence notifications, and use apps like Forest or Focus@Will if needed.\n* **Example:** Keep only your laptop, notebook, and pen on the desk when working.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Harness Motivation: Connect Tasks to Bigger Goals**\n* **Step-by-step reasoning:** Motivation increases when a task has personal meaning or a reward. Procrastination drops when you see *why* a task matters.\n* **Actionable tip:** Link tasks to long-term goals or values and visualize the benefits of completing them. Use small rewards for milestones.\n* **Example:** Completing an assignment now gets you closer to finishing a degree, or treat yourself to a coffee after 30 minutes of focused work.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Use Accountability: External & Self-Tracking**\n* **Step-by-step reasoning:** Knowing someone else is observing or tracking your progress increases commitment and reduces the tendency to delay.\n* **Actionable tip:** Share goals with a friend, join a study/work group, or use a habit tracker to monitor daily completion.\n* **Example:** Tell a friend, “I’ll send you my draft by 5 PM,” or check off each completed microtask on a planner.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Summary:**\n* **Mindset:** Focus on progress, not perfection.\n* **Daily Habits:** Break tasks into microsteps and use time blocks.\n* **Environment:** Minimize distractions and optimize your workspace.\n* **Motivation:** Connect tasks to bigger goals and reward progress.\n* **Accountability:** Track and share progress to stay committed.",
    
    "gemini-2.5": "That's a great approach to tackling procrastination! By breaking it down into different areas, you can create a comprehensive plan.\n\nHere are 5 ways to stop procrastination, organized by the categories you requested, with a step-by-step approach.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Mindset Change: Practice Self-Compassion and Imperfection**\n**The Concept:** Procrastination is often driven by a fear of failure or perfectionism. Being overly critical of yourself makes you want to avoid the task even more. Shifting your mindset to kindness and accepting \"good enough\" is key.\n**Step-by-Step:**\n1. **Acknowledge Without Judgment:** When you catch yourself procrastinating, observe the feeling (e.g., anxiety, fear, overwhelmed) and simply say, \"I am feeling stressed about this task, and that's okay.\"\n2. **Replace Self-Criticism:** Instead of saying, \"I'm so lazy,\" reframe it: \"I am having trouble starting, but I can take one small step right now.\"\n3. **Aim for Progress, Not Perfection:** Remind yourself that the goal is **completion**, not a perfect first attempt. A \"messy first draft\" or \"80% completed\" task is infinitely better than 0%.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Daily Habit: \"Eat the Frog\" First**\n**The Concept:** Tackle your biggest, most important task first thing in the morning. This gives immediate momentum and reduces dread.\n**Step-by-Step:**\n1. Identify your \"Frog\": The night before or first thing in the morning, pick the task you are most likely to avoid.\n2. Start Immediately: Work on it for 15-30 minutes before checking emails or social media.\n3. Celebrate the Win: Completing or significantly starting the \"frog\" gives a surge of motivation for the rest of the day.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Daily Habit: Break Tasks Down with the 5-Minute Rule**\n**The Concept:** Make the task so small that it is impossible to procrastinate.\n**Step-by-Step:**\n1. Identify the Barrier: Look at the task you are avoiding.\n2. Define the Next Tiny Action: Break it into a 5-minute action.\n3. Start for Only 5 Minutes: The goal is to start. Momentum often takes over.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Environment Setup: Eliminate Distractions**\n**The Concept:** Easy access to distractions fuels procrastination.\n**Step-by-Step:**\n1. Create a Dedicated Space: Avoid working in bed or on the couch.\n2. Remove Cues: Put your phone away, close unnecessary browser tabs, clear clutter.\n3. Use Digital Blocks: Use apps/extensions to block distracting websites during work sessions.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Motivation Tip: Use \"Temptation Bundling\" and Rewards**\n**The Concept:** Link a task you need to do with an activity you want to do.\n**Step-by-Step:**\n1. Identify the Want: A small enjoyable activity.\n2. Identify the Need: Task you are putting off.\n3. Bundle Them: Only enjoy the \"Want\" while performing the \"Need\".\n*Example:* \"I will only listen to my favorite podcast while I sort emails.\"\n\n---",

    "claude-3": "# Overcoming Procrastination: A Comprehensive Approach\n\nLet me break this down into five practical strategies that address different aspects of how you work and think.\n\n**1. Reframe Tasks as Progress, Not Perfection**\nThis mindset shift is foundational. Instead of viewing a task as something that needs to be \"done right,\" see it as an opportunity to make progress. Perfectionism keeps you from starting. Daily habit: spend two minutes each morning identifying one task where \"good enough\" is acceptable. Environment: remove reminders of past incomplete projects.\n\n**2. Break Tasks Into Impossibly Small Steps**\nPsychological barriers are often bigger than the task itself. Motivation tip: celebrate tiny wins. Daily habit: write down the next three micro-steps for your most important task each day. Environment: have everything you need immediately accessible.\n\n**3. Use the Two-Minute Rule with Environmental Design**\nMindset: commit only to starting. Daily habit: schedule \"two-minute sessions\" at the same time each day. Environment: prepare workspace in advance, remove distractions. Motivation: recognize that starting naturally leads to momentum.\n\n**4. Create Implementation Intentions and Environmental Triggers**\nMindset: design your surroundings to make desired behavior the path of least resistance. Daily habit: use \"if-then\" statements (e.g., \"if I finish breakfast, then I immediately sit at my desk\"). Environment: use visual cues like checklists, dedicated workspace, focus playlists.\n\n**5. Pair Tasks With Pleasure and Manage Energy, Not Just Time**\nMindset: procrastination is often emotion regulation. Daily habit: pair challenging tasks with something enjoyable. Environment: schedule work during peak energy hours. Motivation tip: acknowledge discomfort is temporary; starting reduces emotional intensity.\n\nThe key is that procrastination isn't a character flaw—it's a predictable response to mindset, habits, environment, and emotions. Adjust these systematically to address root causes."
