    "gemini-2.5": "The Productive & Restorative Weekend Plan\n\nThis plan is designed to segment your weekend into clear blocks, ensuring focused growth and deep rest, following your structure: Morning (Movement & Planning), Midday (Growth & Creativity), and Evening (Connection & Relaxation).\n\nSaturday: Deep Work & Social Connection\n\n☀️ Morning (7:30 AM - 10:00 AM)\n\nLight Exercise (7:30 AM - 8:30 AM): Begin with a dynamic warm-up followed by 30-45 minutes of low-impact activity, such as a brisk walk, gentle yoga, or stretching. Focus on movement, not intensity.\n\nPlanning (8:30 AM - 10:00 AM): The 'Saturday Set-Up' (15-20 mins).\n\nReview: Quickly look over last week's unfinished items.\nPrioritize: Identify one primary growth task for the Midday block (e.g., 'Finish Chapter 3 of Python course,' or 'Write 500 words of the short story').\nFuel: Enjoy a healthy, leisurely breakfast after your planning session.\n\n🧠 Midday (11:00 AM - 2:00 PM)\n\nLearning or Creative Activity (Deep Work): This is your most focused block.\n\nGoal: Tackle the single most important growth task identified in the morning.\nTechnique: Use the Pomodoro Technique (e.g., two 50-minute blocks with a short break in between) to ensure intense focus without burnout. Put your phone away.\nOutput: Aim for tangible results—a finished section, a completed project phase, or a well-defined piece of writing/art.\n\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Evening (5:00 PM onwards)\n\nFamily or Relaxation Time: Fully switch off from productivity mode.\n\nConnection: Dedicate time to family (cooking a meal together, playing a board game, or visiting friends).\nRelaxation: If you live alone, use this time for a complete mental break: watching a film, listening to an album, or engaging in a restorative hobby like knitting.\nDigital Break: Avoid checking work emails or planning for the next week.\n\nSunday: Restoration & Preparation\n\n☀️ Morning (8:00 AM - 10:30 AM)\n\nLight Exercise (8:00 AM - 9:30 AM): A longer, more relaxing physical activity, such as a nature hike, a bicycle ride, or a relaxing swim.\n\nPlanning (9:30 AM - 10:30 AM): The 'Sunday Wrap-Up' (30 mins).\n\nReview: Briefly look at what you accomplished yesterday and reflect on the quality of your rest.\nPreparation: Schedule the week ahead (appointments, key tasks, and blocks for focused work) and confirm your top 3 priorities for Monday.\n\n🎨 Midday (11:30 AM - 2:30 PM)\n\nLearning or Creative Activity (Passive/Inspirational): Shift from deep doing to deep intake or inspiration.\n\nGrowth: Read a non-fiction book, listen to an educational podcast, or browse creative resources related to a new interest.\nCreative: Simple, low-stakes creative outlets like sketching, journaling, or playing a musical instrument for fun. This should be relaxing, not a demanding task.\n\n🧘 Evening (4:00 PM onwards)\n\nFamily or Relaxation Time & Wind-Down:\n\nLight Prep: A brief 30-minute chore session (e.g., laying out clothes, prepping lunches, or tidying the main living space) to reduce Monday morning stress.\nDeep Relaxation: Start your wind-down routine early. Take a warm bath, read fiction, or practice a gratitude exercise.\nScreen Curfew: Implement a 'screen curfew' (e.g., 9:00 PM) to ensure quality sleep.\n\nThe Post-Weekend Review\n\nBefore you go to bed Sunday night, use this checklist to ensure you met your balance goals:\n\nCategory | Yes/No | Notes\n--- | --- | ---\nProductivity |  | Did I accomplish the single deep-work task on Saturday?\nGrowth/Learning |  | Did I dedicate focused time to skill-building or creative pursuit?\nConnection |  | Did I have dedicated, quality time with family/loved ones?\nRest/Energy |  | Do I feel mentally restored and ready for Monday?\nMovement |  | Did I move my body for at least 30 minutes both days?\n\nIf you check 'No' for Mental Rest or Connection, make a note to prioritize those areas next weekend.",
