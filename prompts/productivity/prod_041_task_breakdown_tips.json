    "claude-3": "Task: Learning a new language\nTip: Immerse yourself in the language through multiple channels\n\nExample: Rather than trying to become fluent all at once, engage with the language in different ways—watch shows with subtitles, listen to podcasts during commutes, read children's books, and have conversations with language partners. Each channel reinforces different skills (listening, reading, speaking, comprehension) and keeps the learning process engaging and sustainable."
