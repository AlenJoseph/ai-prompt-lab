5.2 Defect Trend Analysis

After execution, the following analysis will be performed to identify systemic issues:

Component Defect Distribution: Categorize defects by component (ASR, NLU, UI, Integration, Backend).

Example Trend: If 70% of P1/P2 defects are logged against the NLU component, this indicates a high risk in intent resolution and requires immediate dev resource allocation.

Environment Defect Distribution: Identify environments where defects cluster (e.g., Safari on iOS showing high UI defects suggests a mobile compatibility regression).

Root Cause Analysis: For all Critical and High defects, determine the root cause (e.g., poor design spec, coding error, insufficient unit testing).

5.3 Improvement Areas (Lessons Learned)

This section documents what went well and what needs to change for the next cycle.

Process Improvements: e.g., Implement an automated tool for generating accent-specific mock data before the next cycle starts.

Tooling/Environment: e.g., Integrate network throttling simulation directly into the automated regression suite for performance baseline consistency.

Collaboration: e.g., Require NLU team to provide confidence score acceptance criteria alongside the intent mapping documentation to prevent ambiguity in testing.

   - Develop data masking strategy for GDPR compliance in QA environment

3. **Performance Monitoring:**
   - Implement continuous performance monitoring in STAGING environment
   - Set up automated performance regression detection
   - Create performance baseline reports before each sprint

4. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Add automated security scanning to CI/CD pipeline (SAST/DAST)
   - Increase frequency of penetration testing from quarterly to bi-monthly
   - Implement automated compliance checks for GDPR/CCPA

5. **Team Training & Collaboration:**
