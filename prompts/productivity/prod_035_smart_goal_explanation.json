Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### S – Specific\nA goal should be clear and well-defined, answering the questions: who, what, where, why, and how.\n**Example:** Instead of 'I want to get fit,' a specific goal would be: 'I want to run 3 km without stopping.'\n\n---\n\n### M – Measurable\nA goal should have criteria to track progress and know when it’s accomplished.\n**Example:** 'I will read 20 pages of a book every day.' You can measure daily pages read.\n\n---\n\n### A – Achievable\nA goal should be realistic and attainable, considering resources and constraints.\n**Example:** 'I will save ₹5,000 in three months by putting aside ₹1,700 per month.'\n\n---\n\n### R – Relevant\nA goal should align with your broader objectives and priorities.\n**Example:** 'I will complete an online Python course to enhance my programming skills for a career in data analysis.'\n\n---\n\n### T – Time-bound\nA goal should have a clear deadline to create urgency and focus.\n**Example:** 'I will finish writing my essay by Friday at 5 PM.'\n\n---\n\nYou can also combine all five elements into a single SMART goal to see them applied together.",
