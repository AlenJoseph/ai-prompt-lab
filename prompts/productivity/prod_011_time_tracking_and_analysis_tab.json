    "gpt-5": "Here’s a **Task Time Tracking and Efficiency Analysis Table** template for your portfolio — followed by **personalized tips** to improve your time management and overall productivity.\n\n---\n\n### 📊 **Task Time Tracking Table**\n\n| **Task** | **Estimated Time** | **Actual Time Taken** | **Efficiency (%)** | **Notes / Observations** |\n|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|\n| UI Design (Landing Page) | 4 hrs | 5 hrs | 80% | Spent extra time revising layout; unclear initial design brief |\n| Frontend Integration (React) | 6 hrs | 7 hrs | 85% | Minor bugs delayed progress; dependency updates took time |\n| API Integration (Backend) | 5 hrs | 4.5 hrs | 111% | Completed ahead of time; well-prepared endpoints helped |\n| Database Setup (PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM) | 3 hrs | 3 hrs | 100% | Completed on time; followed setup checklist |\n| Testing & Debugging | 4 hrs | 6 hrs | 67% | Missed edge cases; underestimated complexity |\n| Documentation (ReadMe / Manual) | 2 hrs | 1.5 hrs | 133% | Clear structure led to faster completion |\n| Project Review & Deployment | 2 hrs | 2.5 hrs | 80% | Last-minute fixes delayed deployment |\n\n---\n\n### 🧮 **Efficiency Formula**\n\nEfficiency = (Estimated Time / Actual Time Taken) × 100\n\n> ✅ Above 100% → More efficient than expected  \n> ⚠️ 80–99% → Slight delay but acceptable  \n> 🔴 Below 80% → Needs review of time allocation or workflow\n\n---\n\n### 💡 **Time Management & Efficiency Improvement Tips**\n\n**1. Plan Smarter**  \n- Break large tasks into micro-tasks (e.g., 'Design Header', 'Integrate API Auth')  \n- Use time-blocking or Pomodoro (25–50 min focus sessions with 5–10 min breaks)\n\n**2. Improve Estimations**  \n- Track average time per similar tasks and adjust future estimates accordingly  \n- Add a 10–15% buffer for debugging, reviews, or unplanned interruptions\n\n**3. Minimize Context Switching**  \n- Group similar tasks (e.g., all frontend tasks together) to maintain focus flow  \n- Turn off notifications during coding or writing sessions\n\n**4. Use Tracking Tools**  \n- Tools like Toggl, Clockify, or Notion Time Tracker to log time per task  \n- Review weekly to identify recurring time sinks\n\n**5. Post-Task Reflection**  \n- After each task, ask: 'What slowed me down?' and 'How can I prevent that next time?'  \n- Adjust processes or tools (e.g., code snippets, templates) for recurring tasks\n\n**6. Energy Alignment**  \n- Schedule high-focus work (coding, design) during your most alert hours  \n- Use low-energy periods for reviews, emails, or documentation\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to create an auto-fill table template (in Excel or Notion-ready format) so you can start tracking your own portfolio tasks directly?",
    
    "gemini-2.5": "That sounds like a great way to gain insight into your workflow! I can certainly outline the table structure for tracking your portfolio tasks and provide some general time management tips.\n\nSince I don't have access to your personal portfolio data, I'll provide a template you can use to fill in your specific tasks and times.\n\n## 📊 Portfolio Task Analysis Table Template\n\n| Task | Estimated Time | Actual Time Taken | Efficiency |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **(e.g., Wireframing Landing Page)** | (e.g., 4 hours) | (e.g., 5 hours) | **(Calculated)** |\n| **(e.g., Drafting Case Study Text)** | (e.g., 8 hours) | (e.g., 7 hours) | **(Calculated)** |\n| **(e.g., Sourcing Assets)** | (e.g., 2 hours) | (e.g., 3 hours) | **(Calculated)** |\n| **(e.g., Final Review & Polish)** | (e.g., 1 hour) | (e.g., 1 hour) | **(Calculated)** |\n\n### How to Calculate Efficiency\n\nEfficiency = (Estimated Time / Actual Time Taken) × 100%\n\n- A score **over 100%** means you finished the task faster than estimated.  \n- A score **under 100%** means the task took longer than estimated.  \n- A score of **100%** means you were perfectly on target.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Tips to Improve Time Management and Boost Efficiency\n\n**1. Refine Your Estimation Process**  \n- Break down large tasks into smaller steps like 'Header Design', 'Footer Layout', etc.  \n- Add a 1.5× buffer to your estimates to account for unexpected issues.\n\n**2. Minimize Distractions and Context Switching**  \n- Use time-blocking to schedule focused work periods.  \n- Apply the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes work + 5 minutes break).\n\n**3. Prioritize Ruthlessly**  \n- Use the Eisenhower Matrix to distinguish between urgent/important tasks.  \n- Focus on important, non-urgent portfolio improvements first.\n\n**4. Continuous Improvement**  \n- Batch similar tasks together to reduce mental load.  \n- Review weekly which tasks took longest and adjust estimates for future work.\n\nWould you like me to provide resources or templates for time-blocking or the Pomodoro Technique?",
    
    "claude-3": "I've created an interactive Portfolio Task Time Tracker for you!\n\n**Features:**  \n- Track tasks with estimated vs. actual time  \n- Calculate efficiency automatically (>100% = early, 80–100% = on track, <80% = delayed)  \n- View stats like total time and average efficiency  \n- Add or delete tasks easily\n\n**How to use it:**  \n1. Enter task name, estimated hours, and actual hours  \n2. Add to tracker to view automatic efficiency calculation  \n3. Identify which types of tasks exceed or meet time goals\n\n**Key Insights:**  \n- Efficiency >100% → finished faster than expected  \n- Efficiency 80–100% → reasonable and healthy  \n- Efficiency <80% → review task scope or estimation\n\n**Tips Included:**  \n- Task breakdown and estimation refinement  \n- Focus techniques (Pomodoro, batching)  \n- Continuous review for pattern recognition"
