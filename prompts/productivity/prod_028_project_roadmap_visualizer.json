    "gpt-5": "Got it! I can create a visual roadmap outline from a project plan. To make it accurate, I need the project plan details — for example, tasks, timeline, and key objectives.\n\nMeanwhile, here’s a generic template of a project roadmap with milestones, deliverables, dependencies, and captions. You can later plug in your project-specific items:\n\n---\n\n### Project Roadmap Visual Outline\n\n#### Milestone 1: Project Initiation\n* Deliverables: Project charter, initial requirements document, stakeholder list\n* Dependencies: None (starting point)\n* Caption: “Laying the foundation: defining scope, objectives, and stakeholders.”\n\n#### Milestone 2: Planning & Design\n* Deliverables: Detailed project plan, risk assessment, design mockups, resource allocation\n* Dependencies: Completion of Project Initiation\n* Caption: “Blueprints ready: designing the roadmap and assigning resources.”\n\n#### Milestone 3: Development / Implementation Start\n* Deliverables: Functional modules, initial prototypes, setup environments\n* Dependencies: Approval of Planning & Design documents\n* Caption: “Turning plans into action: coding, building, and initial testing.”\n\n#### Milestone 4: Testing & QA\n* Deliverables: Test cases, QA reports, bug-fix logs\n* Dependencies: Completion of Development/Implementation\n* Caption: “Ensuring quality: validating functionality and performance.”\n\n#### Milestone 5: Deployment\n* Deliverables: Final product release, deployment guide, user manuals\n* Dependencies: Successful Testing & QA completion\n* Caption: “Launch time: delivering the solution to end-users.”\n\n#### Milestone 6: Review & Closure\n* Deliverables: Project closure report, lessons learned, post-deployment support plan\n* Dependencies: Deployment complete\n* Caption: “Reflect and wrap up: evaluating success and documenting insights.”\n\n---\n\nI can also convert this into a visual Gantt-style roadmap or timeline diagram with arrows showing dependencies, color-coded milestones, and captions beneath each stage. Do you want me to create a visual diagram next?",
    "gemini-2.5": "To create a meaningful visual roadmap, I need the details of your project plan first. Please provide:\n1. Project Name/Goal\n2. Tasks/Phases\n3. Estimated Start/End Dates for key phases/tasks (if available)\n\nOnce I have these, I will organize them into milestones, deliverables, dependencies, and captions for a visual roadmap.\n\n---\n\nExample output structure:\n| Milestone (#) | Caption | Key Deliverables | Dependencies |\n| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- |\n| M1 | Project Kick-Off & Requirements Finalized | Signed Scope Document, Technical Requirements Document (TRD) | None (Start) |\n| M2 | Core System Architecture Approved | Architecture Diagram, Tech Stack Selection | M1 |\n| M3 | Beta Testing Complete | Tested Codebase, Bug Report Log, Final User Feedback | M2, Development Phase Complete |\n\nPlease provide your project details to proceed.",
    "claude-3": "I'd be happy to help you create a visual roadmap! To convert it into a visual roadmap with milestones, deliverables, and dependencies, please provide:\n1. Your project plan details — including phases, timeline, key milestones, and deliverables\n2. Project scope — what you are building/delivering\n3. Dependencies — which tasks depend on others\n4. Timeline — start date, duration, target completion\n\nOnce shared, I can design a professional visual roadmap showing all milestones with captions, deliverables, dependencies, and sequence."
