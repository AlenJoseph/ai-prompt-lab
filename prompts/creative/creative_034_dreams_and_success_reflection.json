    "gpt-5": "When a person’s dreams finally come true, it feels like stepping into sunlight after a long storm. Every struggle, doubt, and sleepless night suddenly gains meaning. The lessons learned along the way—patience, resilience, and faith—become more valuable than the achievement itself. The emotional rush of joy and relief can be overwhelming, often mixed with disbelief that the dream once imagined is now real. Success also changes perspective; it reveals that the journey mattered just as much as the destination and that true fulfillment lies in growth, not perfection. In the end, perseverance turns dreams into reality, and gratitude keeps the heart humble enough to dream again.",
    "gemini-2.5": "The moment a person’s dream comes true is rarely a sudden flash; it is a slow, powerful culmination of years spent in the deep trenches of effort. The core lessons learned are typically forged in the fires of failure: patience, resilience in the face of relentless doubt, and the quiet, unwavering commitment to showing up even when progress felt invisible. Upon achieving that goal, the emotional reaction is a complex, overwhelming surge. It is an immediate, disbelieving elation that quickly settles into a profound, quiet sense of internal validation. This success profoundly changes one's perspective, transforming a person’s mental landscape. The once-impenetrable wall of the impossible suddenly becomes a concrete foundation, proving that self-belief is the most powerful resource. You realize that your capabilities extend far beyond what you previously permitted yourself to imagine. May this success serve not as an endpoint, but as a potent reminder of the power of perseverance and the necessity of gratitude—for the strength you found within yourself and the people who supported you on the journey.",
    "claude-3": "When a dream finally becomes reality, it rarely arrives in a vacuum. It emerges from the convergence of belief, effort, timing, and often a willingness to adapt along the way. The dream itself—that spark of possibility—serves as the compass, but it's the daily choices, the resilience through setbacks, and the openness to unexpected paths that ultimately bring it into being. The emotional reaction is profound. There's often a moment of disbelief, a surreal pause where the mind struggles to reconcile what was once abstract with what is now tangible. Then comes the flood—gratitude, joy, sometimes even tears. But woven through these emotions is often humility, a quiet recognition of how many things had to align, how many people supported the journey, and how much remained beyond anyone's control. The lessons learned reshape who we become. We discover reservoirs of strength we didn't know we possessed. We learn that obstacles aren't barriers but teachers, and that failure is rarely final. We understand that growth matters more than the destination, and that the person we become in pursuit of our dream is often the real prize. With success comes a shift in perspective. What once seemed impossibly distant now feels within reach. The fear that once felt paralyzing transforms into determination. And perhaps most importantly, we begin to see that our achievement was never just about us—it becomes a silent testimony to others that their dreams, too, are possible. As you move forward, remember that perseverance is not the absence of doubt or difficulty, but the choice to continue despite them. Every dream worth having demands this commitment. And as your dreams become reality, let gratitude be your anchor—for the lessons, the struggles, the people who believed, and for the strength you discovered in yourself. Your success is not an ending but an invitation to dream even bigger."
