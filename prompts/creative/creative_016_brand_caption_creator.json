    "gemini-2.5": "That's a fun challenge! Finding a short, impactful slogan that connects the beauty of the **Aurora** (Northern Lights) with the warmth and experience of the **coffee industry** requires a blend of poetry and promise.\n\nHere are a few options for **Aurora** (Coffee Industry) captions, aiming for that concise, evocative style:\n\n---\n\n### ☕ Aurora Coffee Captions\n\n| Theme | Caption | Explanation |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Experience** | **A Moment, Illuminated.** | Focuses on coffee as a bright, special part of the day, much like the Aurora is a bright, special part of the night. |\n| **Quality** | **The Peak of Morning.** | Uses \"peak\" to suggest the highest quality coffee experience, relating to the peak viewing of the lights or a mountain peak often associated with a grand view. |\n| **Feeling** | **Find Your Glow.** | Short, encouraging, and connects the visible \"glow\" of the Aurora to the internal, energetic feeling coffee provides. |\n| **Sensation** | **Brewed with Wonder.** | Highlights the magical, awe-inspiring feeling of both the natural phenomenon and a perfectly crafted cup. |\n\n---\n\n**Which of these strikes the best balance of inspiration and coffee connection for the Aurora brand?**",
    "claude-3": "I'd be happy to help create captions for Aurora in the coffee industry! Here are some options that follow the style of those brand taglines:\n\n1. **Aurora Coffee: Brew the Dawn** — Captures the brand name (aurora = dawn) with the coffee experience, suggesting a fresh start to your day.\n2. **Aurora Coffee: Rise with Excellence** — Combines the uplifting nature of dawn with a commitment to quality, perfect for a premium coffee brand.\n3. **Aurora Coffee: Where Light Meets Flavor** — Poetic and evocative, suggesting both the visual beauty of an aurora and the rich experience of great coffee.\n4. **Aurora Coffee: Illuminate Your Moment** — Short and punchy, implying that their coffee brightens everyday moments.\n5. **Aurora Coffee: Pure Light, Pure Taste** — Dual focus on purity—both visual (the aurora's natural beauty) and in coffee quality.\n6. **Aurora Coffee: Every Cup Glows** — Simple, memorable, and suggests that their coffee makes each moment special and radiant.\n\nMy personal favorites are **\"Brew the Dawn\"** (concise and clever wordplay) and **\"Where Light Meets Flavor\"** (more sophisticated and descriptive). The first works well for marketing across social media and ads, while the second feels more premium and narrative-driven.\n\nWhich direction resonates most with Aurora's brand personality—playful and energetic, or premium and refined?"
