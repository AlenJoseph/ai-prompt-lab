    "gpt-5": "Here’s a skit draft on **Social Media Addiction** with 5 characters:\n\n---\n\n**Title:** *Lost in the Scroll*\n\n**Characters:**\n1. **Arya** – Always on social media\n2. **Rohan** – Arya’s friend, concerned about her\n3. **Maya** – Arya’s sister, practical and caring\n4. **Sam** – Classmate, addicted to likes and comments\n5. **Teacher** – Wise, gives advice\n\n---\n\n**Scene 1: At Arya’s room**\n\n*(Arya is lying on the bed, scrolling on her phone. Sam enters.)*\n\n**Sam:** Hey Arya! Check my new post! I got 200 likes already!\n\n**Arya:** Wow… that’s… great. Wait, let me check mine. *[scrolls endlessly]*\n\n**Sam:** You’re always on your phone. Don’t you get tired?\n\n**Arya:** No… I just… I feel like if I stop, I’ll miss something important.\n\n*(Rohan knocks and enters.)*\n\n**Rohan:** Arya! We’re meeting Maya and friends for coffee. Come on, put your phone down for a while.\n\n**Arya:** Umm… maybe later. Just a few more minutes.\n\n---\n\n**Scene 2: Living Room**\n\n*(Maya enters, notices Arya still on the phone.)*\n\n**Maya:** Arya, you’ve been on that phone all day! You didn’t eat lunch yet.\n\n**Arya:** I’ll eat later… I’m busy scrolling.\n\n**Maya:** Scrolling? You’re scrolling through life!\n\n**Arya:** What do you mean? I’m connecting with everyone!\n\n**Maya:** You’re connected online, but disconnected from us.\n\n---\n\n**Scene 3: Classroom / Teacher’s Advice**\n\n*(Teacher notices Sam and Arya on phones during class.)*\n\n**Teacher:** Arya, Sam, phones away, please. Look around you. Life isn’t a feed you can scroll endlessly.\n\n**Sam:** But teacher, likes and comments… they feel important.\n\n**Teacher:** True, but only real interactions give meaning. Too much time online can make you forget what’s real.\n\n**Arya:** I… I never thought of it that way.\n\n**Teacher:** Try a day without social media. Talk to friends, laugh, play… live.\n\n---\n\n**Scene 4: Next Day – Coffee with Friends**\n\n*(Arya, Rohan, Maya, and Sam are together, phones down.)*\n\n**Arya:** You know… yesterday I realized I was missing out on real moments.\n\n**Sam:** Me too. Likes don’t make you happy. Friends do.\n\n**Maya:** Let’s promise to enjoy life more than scrolling life away.\n\n**Rohan:** Agreed! No phones for a while!\n\n*(They all laugh and chat, enjoying the moment.)*\n\n---\n\n**Message at the End:**\n*\"Social media connects us, but real life experiences make us truly alive. Don’t let scrolling steal your moments.\"*",
    
    "gemini-2.5": "## 🎭 Screen Life: A Skit on Social Media Addiction 📱\n\n---\n\n### **Characters**\n1.  **MAYA:** (17) Obsessively checks her phone, chasing 'likes'.\n2.  **LIAM:** (18) Maya's friend, constantly scrolling and multitasking.\n3.  **MR. SINGH:** (50s) A teacher, trying to have a real conversation.\n4.  **GRANDMA HELEN:** (70s) Liam's grandmother, observes the modern obsession.\n\n### **Setting**\nA park bench on a sunny afternoon.\n\n---\n\n### **The Skit**\n\n*(SCENE START)*\n\n*(MAYA and LIAM are sitting on a park bench. They are both engrossed in their phones. MR. SINGH is sitting nearby, reading a physical book.)*\n\n**MR. SINGH:** Ah, what a beautiful day! The sun is perfect.\n\n**(Maya and Liam don't look up, only offering a vague sound.)**\n\n**MAYA:** Yes, but did you see Chloe's story? She's at the beach. Ugh, I wish I was there. This park bench is so... *basic*.\n\n**LIAM:** Wait, wait. Someone just replied to my post. He called my new sneakers fake. I have to shut him down.\n\n**MR. SINGH:** Basic? Fake? Why don't you look up and appreciate the *real* view? Look at that tree—it must be a hundred years old.\n\n**GRANDMA HELEN:** Hello, dear boys and girls. What lovely screens you have. They must be filled with such important things.\n\n**LIAM:** Hi, Grandma. Yeah, super important. Gotta check this new reel. It's only 15 seconds, but it feels like I'd miss everything if I didn't see it *right now*.\n\n**MAYA:** I missed a notification! Was it the 100th like? No, just an ad. **False alarm.** My heart jumped.\n\n**MR. SINGH:** They're trapped. They’re chasing small digital rewards instead of big, real moments.\n\n**GRANDMA HELEN:** Connected? You're sitting inches apart, but you are miles away. Connection is eye contact. It's the scent of these flowers. It's Mr. Singh's book.\n\n**LIAM:** *(slowly lowers his phone)*\n\n**MAYA:** *(quietly)* My coffee isn't even that good.\n\n**LIAM:** Hey, Maya... did you finish that history project?\n\n**MAYA:** No, let's talk about it now.\n\n---\n\n### **Message of the Skit**\nSocial media is a useful tool, but when we chase endless likes and notifications, we forget to engage with the **real world** and the **real people** right in front of us. Don't let your screen be a barrier to genuine connection and the simple, beautiful moments of life. **Look up.**",
