    "gemini-2.5": "That sounds like fun! I'm ready to write a joyful pop anthem. Here are the lyrics:\n\n---\n\n**Title:** *Electric Sky*\n\n**Verse 1:**\nWoke up this morning, sunshine hit the blind\nA little whisper saying, \"Leave the stress behind\"\nGot that Friday feeling on a Tuesday afternoon\nA sudden shift in gravity, heading for the moon\nYeah, the air is buzzing, feel it in my feet\nThis ordinary sidewalk sounds like a drumming beat\n\n**Pre-Chorus:**\nUsed to wait for magic, wait for a sign\nBut I finally figured out the magic's mine\nIt's a chemical reaction, a brilliant, wild release\nNow I'm shouting out the window, looking for the heat!\n\n**Chorus:**\nOh, it's an electric sky, a flash of brilliant gold\nA story in my heart that's finally being told\nGot that zero-to-sixty, full-throttle kind of high\nYeah, I'm soaring on this feeling, nothing can pass me by\nLet the bass drop low, let the rhythm take control\nThis is the sound of a happy soul!\n\n**Verse 2:**\nRemember the shadows, the cloudy, gray unknown?\nThey packed their bags and left, now I'm standing on my own\nThe colors are brighter, the music's in my stride\nLike finding a hidden diamond that I used to try to hide\nIt's the simplest moments, a laugh that catches fire\nJust pure, unedited, boundless desire\n\n**Pre-Chorus:**\nUsed to wait for magic, wait for a sign\nBut I finally figured out the magic's mine\nIt's a chemical reaction, a brilliant, wild release\nNow I'm shouting out the window, looking for the heat!\n\n**Chorus:**\nOh, it's an electric sky, a flash of brilliant gold\nA story in my heart that's finally being told\nGot that zero-to-sixty, full-throttle kind of high\nYeah, I'm soaring on this feeling, nothing can pass me by\nLet the bass drop low, let the rhythm take control\nThis is the sound of a happy soul!\n\n**Bridge:**\nDon't need a destination, don't need a master plan\nJust need this energy flowing, connecting with the jam\nIt’s like confetti falling, every single glance\nThis is my moment, this is my joyful dance!\n\n**Chorus:**\nOh, it's an electric sky, a flash of brilliant gold\nA story in my heart that's finally being told\nGot that zero-to-sixty, full-throttle kind of high\nYeah, I'm soaring on this feeling, nothing can pass me by\nLet the bass drop low, let the rhythm take control\nThis is the sound of a happy soul!\n\n**Outro:**\nElectric sky! (Yeah, the feeling's right)\nHappy soul! (Shining like a light)\nZero to sixty!\nLet it go, let it go, let it go!\n---"
