    "gpt-5": "**🎬 Short Film Concept: “The Last Light”**\n**Genre:** Drama / Inspirational\n\n---\n\n### **Main Concept:**\nIn a small town that has faced years of drought and despair, a young girl discovers an old, broken streetlamp that still flickers faintly at night. Her belief that it can shine again becomes a symbol of hope for an entire community that has forgotten how to dream.\n\n---\n\n### **Characters:**\n* **Mira (10 years old):** A curious and imaginative girl who believes that even broken things can glow again.\n* **Ravi (35 years old):** Mira’s father, a former mechanic who lost faith after the town’s factory shut down.\n* **Grandma Leela (70 years old):** The town storyteller who teaches Mira the importance of believing in small miracles.\n* **Town People:** Represent collective despair—until Mira’s act begins to change them.\n\n---\n\n### **Message to be Conveyed:**\nEven in moments of darkness, a small spark of belief can reignite the light of an entire community. Hope is not found—it’s created, shared, and kept alive by human connection.\n\n---\n\n### **Visual Tone:**\n* **Color Palette:** Muted sepia tones at the beginning to reflect dryness and decay, slowly transitioning into warmer hues—amber and gold—as hope rekindles.\n* **Cinematography:**\n  * Wide, still shots to capture isolation.\n  * Close-ups on flickering lights, reflections, and eyes to symbolize inner light.\n  * The final scene features the repaired streetlamp glowing brightly, surrounded by children playing under its light.\n* **Music:** Gentle piano and strings that rise with emotion—ending in a soft crescendo symbolizing renewal.\n\n---\n\n**Tagline:**\n*“Even the smallest light can guide a lost heart home.”* 🌙✨",
    
    "gemini-2.5": "🎬 Action!\n\n## 🌟 Film Idea: The Last Bloom\n\n### Title and Genre\n* **Title:** **The Last Bloom**\n* **Genre:** Dramatic Short / Magical Realism\n\n---\n\n### Main Concept\nThe world is encased in a perpetual, muted grey, an oppressive atmosphere resulting from a slow environmental collapse. Nothing has truly *grown* in years. **Elias**, a cynical, aging architect, lives in silent resignation, convinced hope is a foolish relic.\n\nThe story centers on a single, seemingly miraculous discovery: a tiny, vibrant **green sprout** pushing through the cracked concrete of a forgotten rooftop garden, the first sign of life the city has seen in a decade.\n\n**Lila**, a young, idealistic student who volunteers at a dilapidated community center, sees the sprout as a symbol of defiance and a mandate for action. Elias initially wants to ignore it or even destroy it, viewing its inevitable demise as proof of his worldview. Lila, however, tirelessly protects the sprout—watering it with scavenged water, shielding it from the corrosive dust, and sharing its secret with the few people who haven't given up entirely.\n\nThe climax occurs when a sudden, harsh acid rain threatens to destroy the fragile plant. Elias, watching from his window, must choose between his comfortable nihilism and risking everything to save a single, tiny, utterly hopeful life.\n\n---\n\n### Characters\n* **Elias (60s):** An architect. Bitter, brilliant, and deeply lonely. He used to design sustainable cities but gave up after the \"Great Fade,\" now living in a state of suspended grief. He is the embodiment of **lost hope**.\n* **Lila (20s):** A tenacious and gentle student. She remembers the stories of the world before the grey and actively seeks out beauty. She represents **active hope**—the kind that requires effort and belief.\n* **The Sprout:** A non-human character, a tiny, vivid green symbol of **potential and resilience**.\n\n---\n\n### Message to be Conveyed\nThe short film will convey the message that **hope is not a passive wish; it is an active choice and a tangible, resilient force, even in the bleakest of circumstances.** True change begins with protecting and nourishing the smallest spark of possibility. You don't need a guarantee of success to have hope—you just need the courage to care.\n\n---\n\n### Visual Tone\n* **Color Palette:** Dominated by desaturated **greys, muted blues, and dusty browns**. The only vibrant color in the entire film will be the **deep, luminous green of the sprout**, and later, the faint, warm **golden light** that appears as Elias makes his choice.\n* **Camera Work:** Slow, deliberate pans and high-angle shots to emphasize the crushing scale of the city and the smallness of the characters. When focused on the sprout, the camera uses extreme close-ups with a shallow depth of field, making the tiny plant feel immense and central.\n* **Setting:** Crumbling, Brutalist architecture, vast, silent streets, and dust-covered interiors. The contrast between the industrial decay and the soft light on the sprout is key.\n\n---\n\nThat's the blueprint. Now, let's find our Elias and get this story moving.",
    
    "claude-3": "# **The Last Light**\n**Genre:** Magical Realism Drama\n\n---\n\n## **Main Concept**\nA burned-out social worker discovers a mysterious child who appears during the city's darkest winter night—a child who seems to exist outside normal reality. Through their unlikely encounter in an abandoned community center, the worker rediscovers their own sense of purpose and learns that hope isn't about changing everything; it's about choosing to show up for one person when the world feels impossibly broken.\n\n---\n\n## **Characters**\n**Maya** (40s) — A jaded social worker who has spent two decades helping others but has lost faith in systemic change. She's preparing to resign, convinced her work amounts to nothing.\n\n**Eli** (ageless, appears 8-10) — A luminous, enigmatic child who seems to know things they shouldn't. They appear quietly in the community center where Maya works late one winter night, claiming to be 'waiting for someone to remember.'\n\n**James** — Maya's supervisor (brief appearances), representing bureaucratic indifference that has worn her down.\n\n---\n\n## **Message**\nHope isn't a grand gesture or a complete fix. It's the small act of staying present, of refusing to look away, of believing that one person's attention and care matters—even when systems fail and statistics overwhelm. It's finding meaning in the connection itself, not in guaranteed outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## **Visual Tone**\n**Color Palette:** Desaturated grays, cold blues, and browns dominate the winter city until Eli appears—then warm amber and soft gold gradually bleed into scenes. The contrast between these palettes grows subtly throughout, never fully saturating, suggesting quiet transformation rather than melodrama.\n\n**Cinematography:** Long, still shots of empty streets and institutional buildings. When Maya and Eli interact, the camera moves closer, more intimate. Handheld moments during emotional beats create vulnerability. Scenes shot through windows, doorways, and reflections—barriers dissolving as connection deepens.\n\n**Lighting:** Cold fluorescents in the social services office. Candlelight and moonlight in the community center. Eli seems to carry their own gentle luminescence—achieved through subtle practical lights and careful color grading rather than obvious fantasy effects.\n\n**Sound Design:** Quiet. The ambient hum of the city, wind, footsteps. Eli's voice is clear and calm. Moments of silence create space for reflection rather than filling every gap with music.\n\n**Pacing:** Deliberately slow, meditative. Long conversations. Time to sit with small moments—a shared meal, watching snow fall, Eli teaching Maya to see something familiar in a new way.\n\n---\n\nThis story trusts the audience to find meaning in intimacy and presence rather than spectacle, leaving them questioning what they believe about hope and why showing up matters."
