    "gemini-2.5": "That's a lovely idea! Here is a versatile prompt that you can use to generate a short story about love, offering a few creative directions:\n\n## 💌 Short Story Prompt: The Unspoken Connection\n\n**Core Concept:** Write a short story (approx. 500–1,000 words) centered on two characters and a significant moment where an act of profound love, commitment, or understanding is expressed **without a single spoken 'I love you.'**\n\n### Key Elements to Include:\n\n* **The Setting:** A location that subtly reflects the emotional state of the characters (e.g., a bustling, chaotic train station; a quiet, worn-out bookstore; a high-stakes, competitive kitchen).\n* **The Characters:** Two individuals whose relationship dynamic is established early on (e.g., lifelong best friends, a newly dating couple facing a crisis, colleagues with a secret past, parent and adult child).\n* **The Conflict/Tension:** A moment of crisis, uncertainty, or vulnerability that requires one character to make a difficult choice or a sacrifice for the other.\n* **The Unspoken Climax:** The action, gesture, or non-verbal exchange that serves as the ultimate expression of their bond. Focus on sensory details (what they see, touch, hear, or smell) to convey the depth of the feeling.\n\n### Choose One Creative Constraint:\n\n1. **The Unexpected Sacrifice:** Character A must give up something they desperately want (a job, a dream, a cherished possession) to ensure Character B's well-being or success. The act must be carried out quietly, without seeking recognition.\n2. **The Silent Understanding:** Character B is experiencing deep distress (fear, grief, overwhelming stress). Character A doesn't try to fix it with words but instead uses a familiar routine or a simple physical act (like making a specific cup of tea, tying a shoelace, or fixing a broken item) to bring them back to a place of safety and calm.\n3. **The Future Handshake:** The story revolves around a single shared decision (e.g., signing a lease, adopting a pet, moving to a new city). The moment they commit to this future, their hands meet or a brief glance is exchanged, sealing their love and commitment more powerfully than any spoken vow.\n\n---\n\n**Try beginning your story with:**\n\n> *The rain had stopped hours ago, but the city air still held that specific, heavy scent of wet pavement and exhaust. [Character Name] watched [Character Name] from across the room, the distance between them feeling miles wider than the actual ten feet.*\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to use this prompt to generate a short story draft for you, or would you like to refine the prompt further?",
    "claude-3": "Here's a prompt you can use to generate a short story about love:\n\n---\n\n**Write a short story about love.

For example, you could specify:\n- A particular genre (romantic comedy, fantasy, realistic fiction, etc.).\n- The tone you're going for (heartwarming, bittersweet, passionate, etc.).\n- Specific character types or backgrounds.\n- Whether it should be a first meeting, rekindled romance, or established relationship.\n\nThe more specific you are about what you're looking for, the better the story will turn out.
