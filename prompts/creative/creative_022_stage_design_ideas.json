    "gemini-2.5": "That's an exciting project! As a stage designer, I can offer a creative and romantic theme idea for a wedding stage that focuses on elegance, intimacy, and natural beauty.\n\n---\n\n## 🌹 Ethereal Enchanted Garden Stage Design 🌿\n\nThis theme transforms the stage into a romantic, softly lit secret garden, offering a beautiful blend of rustic charm and refined elegance.\n\n### Theme Details\n* **Theme:** Ethereal Enchanted Garden\n* **Vibe:** Romantic, mystical, intimate, and timeless.\n\n### Layout and Background Options\n| Option | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Arbor/Mandap Focal Point** | Use a large, organic wooden or wrought-iron arch (arbor/mandap) draped heavily with flowing fabric (like chiffon or tulle) and cascading greenery. This acts as a clear, defined frame for the couple. |\n| **Layered Backdrop** | A backdrop of sheer, white or ivory curtains layered over soft, warm fairy lights (twinkling lights). This creates depth and a magical, diffused glow, mimicking starlight filtering through trees. |\n| **Asymmetrical Seating** | Instead of a single, central couch, use two elegant antique chairs or a small, stylish settee placed slightly off-center to encourage intimate, natural posing. |\n| **Aisle Integration** | Extend the greenery and lighting down the steps leading to the stage, visually merging the stage with the main aisle and making the space feel continuous. |\n\n### Color Palette\n* **Primary:** Forest Green (for foliage) and Ivory/Champagne (for fabric and flooring)\n* **Accents:** Blush Pink (flowers), Gold/Bronze (lighting), Deep Mauve (floral depth)\n* **Lighting:** Warm Amber and soft Pink/Purple washes\n\n### Decorations\n| Element | Specifics and Effect |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Foliage & Florals** | Mix of real and high-quality artificial greenery: Ivy, Eucalyptus, Ferns. Flowers: Garden Roses, Peonies, Hydrangeas. Focus on draping rather than stacking. |\n| **Lighting** | String Lights/Fairy Lights interwoven throughout greenery and backdrop. Lanterns or Edison bulbs hanging at varying heights. Uplighting to illuminate greenery. |\n| **Props & Textures** | Moss and Wood Slices for a grounded feel. Sheer Chiffon or Tulle drapes for drama. |\n| **Stage Floor** | Plush Ivory/Cream carpet or reflective white vinyl to enhance light and greenery. |\n\n### Stage Taglines\n* \"Our Forever Bloom: A Love Grown Here.\"\n* \"Where Two Souls Entwine and Love Begins to Grow.\"\n* \"Beneath the Stars, Our Fairytale Begins.\"\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to develop a contrastingly bold and modern stage theme, or focus on the lighting design for this Enchanted Garden concept?",
