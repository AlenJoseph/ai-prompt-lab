    "gpt-5": "Absolutely! Let’s imagine human emotions as weather patterns—each with its own atmosphere, movement, and energy:\n\n### 1. Joy — Sunlit Breeze\nA bright, warm morning with golden sunlight streaming through the sky. Gentle breezes carry the scent of blooming flowers, making everything feel alive and effortless. Colors are vivid, the air is light, and there’s a soft sparkle on every surface. Joy is the weather that makes you want to stretch your arms out and run freely.\n\n### 2. Sadness — Drizzling Mist\nA soft, persistent drizzle cloaks the world in a quiet gray haze. Mist hugs the ground and blurs the edges of everything, creating a feeling of introspection. Sounds are muffled, streets glisten with tiny puddles, and the air feels heavy yet calm. Sadness is slow, contemplative rain that invites reflection rather than frenzy.\n\n### 3. Anger — Thunderstorm Fury\nDark clouds gather rapidly, flashing with jagged lightning and roaring thunder. Wind lashes through trees, scattering leaves, while heavy rain lashes down in bursts. The storm is sudden and intense, unrelenting yet cathartic, shaking the environment and demanding attention. Anger is a tempest that forces everything to confront its power.\n\n### 4. Fear — Shivering Fog\nDense, chilling fog envelops the landscape, making shapes indistinct and shadows deeper. Every sound is magnified, every movement uncertain. The air feels cold and still, with an underlying tension that makes each step cautious. Fear is the fog that hides paths, leaving you alert and uneasy, aware of dangers unseen.\n\n### 5. Hope — Sunrise After Storm\nThe sky is a mosaic of past storm clouds and emerging light. Rays of warm, gentle sun pierce through lingering gray, painting the world with soft pastels. Birds begin to sing, and the air smells fresh and renewed. Hope is the calm after turmoil, the weather that whispers of possibilities and new beginnings.",
    
    "gemini-2.5": "Here are five human emotions represented as unique weather patterns:\n\n### 🎨 Emotions as Weather Patterns\n\n| Emotion | Weather Pattern Representation | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Joy | 🌞 A Midsummer Day's Zenith | Clear, brilliant sunshine with a high, cloudless, azure sky. The air is warm and still, carrying the scent of blooming flowers. A day of uninterrupted clarity and warmth, where every shadow is sharp and every color is vibrant. |\n| Grief | 🌧️ Perpetual Drizzle & Fog Bank | A relentless, chilling drizzle that has lasted for days, accompanied by heavy, low-hanging fog. Visibility is reduced, muffling sound and movement. Constant, low-grade weeping and an overwhelming sense of being lost. |\n| Anger | ⚡ Sudden, Violent Thunderstorm | Starts with a quick, suffocating buildup of dark, purple cumulonimbus clouds. Erupts into crashing thunder and blinding lightning, with torrential, wind-whipped rain or hail. Explosive, chaotic, leaving a sharp, clean scent of ozone. |\n| Calm | 🌬️ Gentle, Persistent Trade Wind | Wispy, high cirrus clouds drift across a pale blue sky. Air is cool and moves with a steady, reliable breeze. No dramatic event, only a gentle, sustaining flow that keeps everything in balance. |\n| Fear/Anxiety | 🌪️ Unpredictable Microburst | Sky is deceptively clear while a small, rapidly rotating funnel of wind and dust touches down nearby. Sudden, localized force. Air feels highly pressurized and expectant, full of nervous tension that could snap at any moment. |",

    "claude-3": "**Emotions as Weather Patterns**\n\n**Joy** is a bright, clear morning after a thunderstorm—golden sunlight breaking through dissipating clouds, warming everything it touches. The air feels crisp and alive. Birds return to sing, and the whole world seems freshly painted. It's the weather of new beginnings, where visibility is perfect.\n\n**Sorrow** manifests as a cold, gray drizzle that goes on indefinitely. Not dramatic or violent, but persistent and heavy. The sky hangs low and close, muffling sound. Puddles form everywhere, reflecting the overcast above. Movement feels slow, and everything is damp.\n\n**Anger** erupts as a violent thunderstorm with jagged lightning, powerful winds that snap branches, and torrential rain that floods the streets. The air crackles with electricity and tension. It's sudden, loud, and overwhelming—a force that demands attention and clears everything from its path.\n\n**Anxiety** swirls as a restless, unseasonable wind that shifts direction constantly—cool then warm, calm then gusting suddenly. The sky is a mix of sun and shadow, never settling. Clouds scuttle across rapidly. Pressure is unsettling and makes everything feel unstable.\n\n**Contentment** settles in as mild, temperate weather—not too hot or cold, with gentle breezes and scattered clouds drifting lazily across a mostly blue sky. Sunlight filters softly. No drama, no urgency. Everything exists in comfortable equilibrium.\n\n**Loneliness** appears as fog—thick and isolating, where even nearby things fade into obscurity. Sound becomes muffled. Visibility shrinks. Surrounded by moisture and dampness, yet profoundly alone."
