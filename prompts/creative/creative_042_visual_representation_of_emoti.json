    "gpt-5": "Emotion: **Joy**\n• **Color Palette:** Warm yellows, bright oranges, and soft pinks; touches of gold or pastel tones to create vibrancy.\n• **Lighting:** Natural sunlight streaming in, glowing highlights, soft lens flares, and an overall radiant brightness.\n• **Music Tone:** Upbeat acoustic guitar or light piano with cheerful percussion; rhythmic tempo that feels uplifting.\n• **Character Actions:** Wide smiles, open gestures, laughing freely, running or dancing with light movements, sparkling eyes full of energy and excitement.",
    "gemini-2.5": "## 🎉 Visualizing the Emotion: Joy\n\nJoy is a vibrant and expansive emotion, and its visual representation should feel **bright, warm, and energetic**.\n\n---\n\n### 🎨 Key Visual Elements\n\n* **Color Palette:** **Bright yellows, warm oranges, and light pastels** (like sky blue or light pink). The overall palette is **high-saturation** and **high-value** (light).\n* **Lighting:** **Bright, high-key lighting** (minimal deep shadows). The light source is often **natural (sunlight)**, suggesting a clear, beautiful day. It might use lens flares or a **golden hour glow** to add warmth and softness.\n* **Music Tone:** **Upbeat, major key melody**. The tempo is moderate to fast. Instruments often include **lively strings (violins), playful woodwinds (flute/piccolo), or bright piano chords**. The overall feel is **airy and effervescent**.\n* **Character Expressions/Actions:**\n    * **Expression:** Wide, genuine **smile** (Duchenne smile, involving the eyes), **bright eyes**, slightly raised eyebrows.\n    * **Actions:** **Energetic and open body language**—arms are often outstretched or raised, light bouncing or skipping, maybe a spontaneous hug or high-five. Posture is **upright and expansive**. Movements are **quick and fluid**.\n\n---\n\n### 🖼️ Example Scene\n\nImagine a character receiving wonderful news. The scene is bathed in **sunlight** (bright lighting), making the room glow with a **soft, warm yellow** hue. A **fast-paced, cheerful orchestral piece** swells as the character throws their hands up in the air (open action), their face splitting into a huge, undeniable **grin** (expression) as they perhaps spin around once out of pure exhilaration.",
    "claude-3": "**Emotion: Joy**\n\n• **Color Palette:** Warm, vibrant hues like golden yellows, bright oranges, and soft pinks. Accents of fresh greens and sky blues create an uplifting atmosphere. Saturated, rich colors that feel alive and energetic.\n\n• **Lighting:** Bright, natural sunlight flooding the scene with a warm glow. Golden hour lighting casts a flattering, radiant quality. No harsh shadows—instead, soft halos of light that seem to embrace the character. Perhaps lens flares or a sun-drenched window creating an ethereal quality.\n\n• **Music Tone:** Uplifting orchestral strings with major key progressions. Bright brass instruments, cheerful woodwinds, or playful piano melodies. The rhythm is lively and buoyant with a moderate to faster tempo. Perhaps incorporating light, tinkling bells or chiming sounds that feel effervescent and weightless.\n\n• **Character Actions:** Open, expansive posture with shoulders relaxed and head held high. Genuine smile that reaches the eyes (crow's feet visible). Animated hand gestures and movement—perhaps dancing, jumping, or reaching upward. Bright, wide-open eyes sparkling with life. Quick, fluid movements that convey energy and vitality. Head tilted slightly upward as if looking toward something beautiful or hopeful."
