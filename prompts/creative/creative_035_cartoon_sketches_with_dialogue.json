    "gpt-5": "Here’s a well-structured creative prompt you can use to generate **cartoon sketches with dialogues** about **online meetings** 👇\n\n---\n\n### 🎨 **Prompt: Cartoon Sketch Generator – Online Meetings**\n\n**Goal:**\nCreate a humorous cartoon sketch series about the struggles, quirks, and funny moments in online meetings.\n\n**Instructions:**\nGenerate a 1–3 panel cartoon sketch on the theme **“Online Meetings.”**\nEach sketch should include:\n\n1. **Setting:** Describe the scene (e.g., people on a video call, glitchy internet, pets interrupting).\n2. **Characters:** 2–4 people with short personality traits (e.g., “the sleepy one,” “the over-enthusiastic boss,” “the person with constant mic issues”).\n3. **Dialogues:** Add realistic and funny dialogues in speech bubbles that reflect online meeting scenarios (e.g., “You’re on mute!”, “Can everyone see my screen?”).\n4. **Expression and Actions:** Mention facial expressions or actions that add humor (e.g., frozen face mid-sentence, person talking to a muted mic).\n5. **Caption or Title:** A short witty caption (under 10 words).\n\n**Tone:** Light, relatable, and humorous.\n**Style:** Simple cartoon or comic strip.\n\n**Example Output Format:**\n\n```\nTitle: “You’re on Mute Again!”\n\nPanel 1:  \n(Scene: Four people on a Zoom call. One person’s face is frozen mid-blink.)  \nCharacter A (excited): “Okay team, can everyone hear me?”  \nCharacter B: “You’re on mute, boss!”  \n\nPanel 2:  \n(Character A unmuted, talking passionately.)  \nCharacter A: “Perfect! So as I was saying—wait, who’s sharing cat videos?”  \n\nPanel 3:  \n(A cat paw hits the keyboard on someone’s screen.)  \nCharacter C (embarrassed): “Sorry, that’s Mr. Whiskers attending the meeting too.”  \n\nCaption: “Another day, another purrformance review.”\n```\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to adapt this prompt specifically for **AI image generation** (like DALL·E or Midjourney) or for **comic script writing** (for a human artist or text-only output)?",
    "gemini-2.5": "That's a fun idea! Here is a detailed prompt you can use to generate cartoon sketches and dialogues about online meetings. I'll break it down into sections covering the overall style, character design, scenarios, and dialogue tone.\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 Cartoon Sketch Prompt: Online Meeting Mishaps\n\n### **1. 🖼️ Overall Style and Format**\n\n* **Style:** Clean, vibrant, modern **cartoon style** (e.g., reminiscent of modern webcomics, *New Yorker* cartoons, or animated explainers). The style should be expressive, simple, and humorous.\n* **Format:** Generate a series of **three (3) separate cartoon panels/sketches**, each focused on a different common online meeting scenario.\n* **Color Palette:** Bright, appealing, and professional, but slightly exaggerated for comic effect.\n\n### **2. 🧑‍💻 Character Design**\n\n* **Protagonists:** Design a core group of 3–4 office workers/professionals (e.g., \"Sarah,\" \"Tom,\" \"Maria,\" \"The Boss\").\n* **Key Features:**\n    * **Exaggerated Expressions:** Focus on highly expressive faces to convey frustration, confusion, or fake enthusiasm.\n    * **Clothing:** Business casual/work-from-home attire (e.g., a nice shirt paired with pajamas/sweatpants visible only from the bottom edge of the frame, or a messy bun/bed head).\n* **Setting:** Each panel should show the characters looking into a laptop/webcam, with visible elements of their home background (e.g., a messy room, a cat walking across the keyboard, a stack of dishes).\n\n### **3. 📋 Scenarios and Dialogue (The 3 Panels)**\n\nCreate a unique scenario for each of the three sketches:\n\n| Panel | Scenario / Focus | Dialogue / Caption |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1** | **The Technical Difficulties Loop** | **Character A (Frustrated):** \"Can you hear me? You're breaking up... I think your Wi-Fi—\" **Character B (Confused):** *Speech bubble showing only a jumble of symbols or garbled text.* |\n| **2** | **The 'You're On Mute' Saga** | **The Boss (Beaming, giving a lengthy presentation):** *Has a prominent 'MUTE' icon visible over their screen/mouth.* **Character C (Whispering/Mouthing to the screen):** \"You're on mute. Boss, you're muted! For the love of...\" |\n| **3** | **The Background Distraction** | **Character D (Trying to look professional):** *Looking straight into the camera, trying to make a serious point.* **Background Detail:** A pet (cat/dog) is performing a clearly distracting or humorous act (e.g., knocking over a plant, walking across the back of the chair). **Dialogue/Caption:** **Character D:** \"...and that's why we need to leverage synergy and optimize our—\" (A sound effect bubble: **'MROW! CRASH!'**) |\n\n### **4. ✨ Key Instructions for the AI**\n\n* **Prioritize Visual Humor:** The humor should come equally from the dialogue and the visual gags/details in the drawing.\n* **Keep the Layout Clear:** Use clear speech bubbles and sound effect bubbles.\n* **Captioning:** Ensure the text is easily legible within the comic panel.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to generate a similar prompt focused on a **different** topic, like commuting or office gossip?",
