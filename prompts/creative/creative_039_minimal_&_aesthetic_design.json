    "gpt-5": "Here’s a **minimal and aesthetic kitchen design plan** that balances functionality, calmness, and natural beauty:\n\n---\n\n### **Theme: “Calm Functionality”**\n\nA serene and clutter-free kitchen that emphasizes clean lines, neutral tones, and organic textures — perfect for modern living.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Essential Elements**\n\n* **Cabinetry:** Handleless flat-panel cabinets with soft-close hinges for a sleek, seamless appearance.\n* **Countertops:** Quartz or natural stone (like honed granite or marble) in light gray, beige, or white tones.\n* **Backsplash:** Subway tiles or continuous stone slab for a cohesive, easy-to-clean surface.\n* **Appliances:** Built-in matte-finish appliances (black, white, or stainless steel) to blend into the design.\n* **Storage:** Pull-out drawers, hidden organizers, and vertical storage solutions to maintain a clutter-free look.\n* **Sink & Faucet:** Undermount sink with a minimalist brushed nickel or matte black faucet.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Natural Materials**\n\n* **Wood:** Use oak or ash veneer for cabinets or open shelving to introduce warmth and texture.\n* **Stone:** Incorporate natural stone countertops or a stone backsplash for earthy appeal.\n* **Ceramics:** Handcrafted ceramic jars or dishes for decor that doubles as functional storage.\n* **Plants:** Small potted herbs or hanging greenery to bring life and freshness to the space.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Neutral Color Palette**\n\n* **Base Colors:** Warm white, soft beige, and light gray for walls and cabinetry.\n* **Accents:** Taupe, sand, or muted olive for open shelving or accessories.\n* **Textures:** Matte and satin finishes instead of glossy, to keep the aesthetic calm and modern.\n* **Contrast:** Use black or charcoal elements sparingly (e.g., light fixtures or handles) for depth.\n\n**Example Palette:** 🤍 *White Quartz* | 🪵 *Natural Oak* | 🌫 *Soft Gray* | ⚫ *Matte Black Accents*\n\n---\n\n### **4. Lighting Ideas for Mood**\n\n* **Ambient Lighting:** Recessed ceiling lights or concealed LED strips under cabinets for soft, even illumination.\n* **Task Lighting:** Focused pendant lights above the island or countertop for meal prep.\n* **Accent Lighting:** Warm-toned LED strips behind open shelves to highlight textures and decor.\n* **Mood Lighting:** Dimmable warm white bulbs (2700–3000K) to create a cozy evening atmosphere.\n\n---\n\n### **Optional Touches**\n\n* **Minimal Decor:** A ceramic fruit bowl, a few cookbooks, or a single framed art piece.\n* **Bar Seating:** Slim stools with natural wood seats and metal frames for balance.\n* **Flooring:** Light wood or polished concrete for a grounded, minimalist finish.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to create a **3D layout sketch or visual mood board** (showing materials, color swatches, and lighting ideas) for this kitchen design?",

    "claude-3": "I've designed a minimal aesthetic kitchen that emphasizes simplicity and natural beauty.\n\n**The Philosophy:** This kitchen strips away excess to reveal pure functionality. Every element serves a purpose, and the material palette—warm whites, soft grays, and natural wood tones—creates a calming, sophisticated space.\n\n**Key Design Features:** The cabinetry uses hidden handles and seamless integration, while open floating shelves display only essential items to maintain visual clarity. The countertops remain spacious and uncluttered, crucial for both aesthetics and practicality. Natural materials like wood, stone, and ceramic add warmth and texture without compromising the clean aesthetic.\n\n**Lighting Strategy:** The lighting design focuses on mood and practicality. Pendant lights with simple geometric forms provide focused ambient light, while under-cabinet LEDs offer task lighting for cooking. Dimmer switches shift from energizing bright light during the day to warm, welcoming tones in the evening. Natural light is maximized through unadorned windows to keep the space feeling open and airy.\n\nThis design succeeds because it respects negative space—the emptiness is as important as the elements present. It’s a kitchen that feels both serene and highly functional."
