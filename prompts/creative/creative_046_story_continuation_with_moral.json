    "gpt-5": "Here’s a meaningful continuation based on your requirements:\n\nOne bright morning, Arun set off into the forest with a small satchel of food and a heart full of curiosity. As he wandered deeper than ever before, he stumbled upon a sparkling, crystal-clear pond surrounded by ancient trees. To his surprise, a small, injured fox lay near the water, struggling to stand. Arun’s first instinct was fear—but his compassion outweighed it. Carefully, he approached the fox and used his scarf to gently wrap its injured leg. He then fed it some of his bread and water from the river.\n\nOver the next few days, Arun returned to the forest to care for the fox, slowly gaining its trust. In time, the fox healed and, in a magical moment, transformed into a forest spirit. The spirit thanked Arun for his kindness and warned him that the forest held both beauty and danger, but those who acted with courage and empathy could find its true wonders.\n\nWhen Arun returned to the village, he shared his story with the villagers, emphasizing that fear alone shouldn’t dictate their lives. Instead, understanding, compassion, and careful courage could guide them safely.\n\nFrom that day on, Arun continued to explore—but always with respect for the forest and its creatures—teaching others that bravery and kindness together could reveal hidden treasures in the world.\n\nMoral: True courage is not the absence of fear, but the ability to act with kindness and wisdom despite it.\n\nEnding: Arun’s adventures continued, but he was no longer just a curious boy—he became a guardian of the forest, bridging the gap between humans and nature.",
    "gemini-2.5": "Once upon a time, in a small village by the river, there lived a young boy named Arun. He loved exploring the forest near his home, even though the villagers warned him about the hidden dangers.\n\nThe Whispering Willow:\n\nOne sunny afternoon, defying his mother's latest plea, Arun ventured deeper than ever before. The sun dappled through the dense canopy, and the air smelled of damp earth and moss. His heart hammered with a thrilling mix of fear and excitement. The villagers' warnings often spoke of a fierce black panther, but Arun was searching for something else—the legendary 'Whispering Willow,' a tree rumored to bear fruit that cured any sickness. His own grandmother had been frail for months, and he was desperate for a remedy.\n\nHe eventually stumbled upon a small, hidden clearing. In the center stood a colossal willow, its branches weeping down like a curtain. Hiding beneath the willow's sweeping branches was not a fierce panther, but a small, frightened fawn, its leg trapped in a tangle of thick, thorny vines.\n\nA Choice of Courage:\n\nArun paused. He could try to reach the fruit and ignore the fawn, but looking at the fawn's eyes, he understood that true danger wasn't always a beast, but the choice to turn away from someone in need. Carefully, he used a sharp stone to cut away the vines, scratching his hands in the process. Finally, the fawn was free and limped away. Arun, tired and disappointed, found he couldn’t reach the fruit.\n\nThe Unexpected Reward:\n\nThe next morning, Arun found a small, beautifully woven basket on his front door. Inside were three glowing berries, the very ones from the legend. His grandmother ate them and began to recover. Arun realized the forest had tested him, rewarding his compassion over selfish pursuit.\n\nMoral lesson: True bravery lies not in conquering visible danger, but in choosing compassion over self-interest.\n\nEnding: Arun learned that the greatest magic is in simple, selfless acts of helping others.",
    "claude-3": "Once upon a time, in a small village by the river, there lived a young boy named Arun. He loved exploring the forest near his home, even though the villagers warned him about the hidden dangers.\n\nOne afternoon, as golden sunlight filtered through the canopy, Arun ventured deeper into the woods than ever before. He ignored the weathered stone marker that said 'Beyond this point, stay together.' His curiosity burned brighter than caution, and he believed himself clever enough to navigate alone.\n\nAs he wandered, admiring the rare orchids and listening to the calls of exotic birds, the forest grew denser. The familiar paths vanished. The sun sank lower, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple. Arun's heart quickened. He tried to retrace his steps, but every direction looked the same. Fear crept in like the gathering shadows.\n\nJust as panic threatened to overwhelm him, he heard a sound—not a danger, but a familiar voice. It was Meena, the village healer's daughter, following the noise of his frightened calls. Behind her came two other villagers with lanterns and rope.\n\n'You were supposed to wait for help,' Meena said, not unkindly, as she guided him back to safety.\n\nThat night, warming by the fire, Arun's grandmother sat beside him. 'The forest holds beauty and knowledge,' she said gently. 'But wisdom is knowing that we need others, not despite our strength, but because of it. The bravest explorers are those who prepare, who listen to warnings, and who know when to ask for company.'\n\nArun looked at the window, where stars twinkled above the darkened forest. The forest hadn't changed. But he had. From that day forward, he continued exploring—with friends, with preparation, and with respect for the warnings born from those who had walked the path before him. He became known as the best guide in the village, not because he ignored danger, but because he had learned to face it wisely."
