    "gemini-2.5": "That's an exciting project! As an interior designer, I can offer several creative and inspiring ways to transform your bedroom into a true sanctuary. A bedroom should reflect your personality while promoting rest and relaxation.\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 Theme Ideas and Color Schemes\n\nChoosing a theme sets the tone for your entire design. Here are a few unique ideas with corresponding color palettes:\n\n| Theme Idea | Vibe | Primary Color Scheme |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **✨ Modern Bohemian** | Relaxed, artistic, global-inspired, and textural. | **Warm Neutrals** (Cream, Beige, Taupe) + **Jewel Tones** (Deep Teal, Mustard Yellow, Terracotta/Rust) |\n| **🌲 Japandi (Japanese + Scandinavian)** | Minimalist, serene, natural, and highly functional. | **Muted Neutrals** (Soft Gray, Off-White) + **Natural Wood Tones** (Light Oak, Walnut) + **Sage Green** or **Muted Blue** |\n| **🏰 Dark Academia** | Intellectual, cozy, moody, and vintage-inspired. | **Rich Tones** (Deep Navy, Forest Green, Burgundy, or Charcoal Gray) + **Warm Accents** (Brass, Gold, and Leather Brown) |\n| **🌊 Coastal Calm** | Bright, airy, tranquil, and nature-inspired. | **Light Neutrals** (Crisp White, Sand) + **Cool Tones** (Seafoam Green, Navy Blue, Sky Blue) |\n\n---\n\n## 🛋️ Furniture Suggestions\n\nThe right furniture is functional art.

It provides extra seating, storage for blankets, and a decorative element.\n    * **Stylish Dresser:** Choose a dresser with unique hardware (like brass knobs) or a painted finish (like distressed white for Coastal Calm, or a dark wood for Dark Academia).\n\n---\n\n## 🖼️ Creative Wall Decor\n\nYour walls are your biggest canvas!\n\n* **Accent Wall:** Create a focal point behind the bed.\n    * **Textured Paint:** Use a technique like **limewash** or a heavily textured paint for a soft, aged, Mediterranean-like look.\n    * **Slat Wood Panels:** Install thin, vertical wooden slats for a modern, Japandi-inspired accent wall.\n    * **Statement Wallpaper:** Choose a lush **botanical print** (Boho/Dark Academia) or a **subtle geometric pattern** (Modern).\n* **Gallery Wall:** Instead of just photos, mix in different mediums:\n    * **Woven baskets or hats** for a Bohemian feel.\n    * **Small mirrors** with unique frames (Sunburst, antique brass).\n    * **Pressed floral frames** or **vintage-style landscape prints** (Dark Academia/Coastal).\n* **Tapestries/Wall Hangings:** A **large, woven macramé piece** or a **fabric wall tapestry** instantly adds softness, texture, and a global vibe.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Lighting Options\n\nLayered lighting is key to a cozy atmosphere. Aim for ambient, task, and accent lighting.\n\n* **Ambient (General Light):** Use a **dimmer switch** on your main overhead light (recessed lighting or a flush mount fixture) to control the mood.\n* **Task (Reading Light):**\n    * **Wall Sconces:** Install **swing-arm sconces** next to the bed instead of table lamps—this frees up nightstand space and looks chic.\n    * **Pendant Lights:** Hang **small pendant lights** down on either side of the bed, replacing traditional table lamps.\n* **Accent (Atmosphere):**\n    * **Fairy/String Lights:** Drape warm white **LED string lights** around a window frame, a headboard, or along a decorative shelf for a soft, magical glow.\n    * **Cove Lighting:** If you have a false ceiling, use **LED strip lights** hidden in the cove for a subtle, upward glow around the perimeter.\n\n---\n\n## 🔨 DIY Tips\n\nAdding personal, handmade touches makes the room truly yours.\n\n* **DIY Headboard:**\n    * **Upholstery:** Cover a simple plywood board with **padding and an interesting fabric** (like textured linen or velvet) to create a custom headboard.\n    * **Reclaimed Wood:** Stain or whitewash reclaimed wood planks and attach them to the wall behind the bed for a rustic or coastal look.\n* **Personalized Art:**\n    * **Abstract Canvas:** Purchase an inexpensive canvas and use acrylic paint to create your own **large abstract art piece** using your color scheme.\n* **Custom Storage:**\n    * **Floating Shelves:** Cut and stain simple wood planks to install as floating shelves for books and decor, using decorative metal brackets for a subtle industrial touch."
