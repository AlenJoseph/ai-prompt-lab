The coin looked beautiful.\n\nTina thought, *‘Maybe I can keep it. No one will know.’*\n\nBut then she remembered what her teacher always said, “Honesty makes your heart shine brighter than gold.”\n\nTina took a deep breath and went to **Mrs. Lily.**\n“Ma’am,” she said, “I found Ravi’s coin near the flowers.”\n\nMrs. Lily smiled warmly. “That’s very honest of you, Tina.

    "gemini-2.5": "**Title:** *The Shiny Red Apple*\n\n**Character:**\n- **Leo** – a small, playful squirrel\n\n---\n\n**Story:**\n\nOne sunny morning, Leo was playing near the big oak tree. He was hungry! Suddenly, he saw something bright red and round on the ground. It was the most beautiful, shiny **red apple** he had ever seen!\n\n\"Yummy!\" thought Leo. He picked it up. He knew it belonged to **Farmer Giles**, who lived nearby and grew the best apples.\n\nLeo looked left. He looked right. No one was watching!\n\n*Should I eat it quickly?* he thought. *Or should I give it back?*\n\nLeo's tummy rumbled, but a little voice in his head said, \"**Honesty is the best choice.**\"\n\nLeo held the apple and slowly hopped toward the farmhouse porch. He felt a little nervous.\n\n**Leo:** “Excuse me, Farmer Giles?”  \n**Farmer Giles:** “Well, hello there, little Leo! What do you have?”  \n**Leo:** “I found this shiny red apple near your fence. I was going to eat it, but I know it’s yours.”  \n**Farmer Giles:** “That’s very honest of you, Leo. Because you told the truth, you can keep the apple as a reward!”\n\nLeo’s eyes grew wide and bright. “Really? Thank you so much!” he said, happily munching the apple that now tasted even sweeter because he had been honest.\n\n---\n\n**Moral:**\n🍎 *Always be honest and tell the truth — honesty brings better rewards than being sneaky!*",

What will Mom say?” he whispered. He decided to hide it under the bed.\n\nThat evening, Mom asked, “Tommy, where’s your new car?”\n\nTommy looked down. “Um… I don’t know, Mom,” he said quietly. It wasn’t true.\n\nMom frowned. “Tommy, I trust you to tell me the truth. Did something happen to it?”\n\nTommy felt sad inside. That night, he couldn’t sleep. The next morning, he went to his mom and said, “I’m sorry, Mom. I broke the toy car and hid it because I was scared.”\n\nHis mom hugged him gently. “Thank you for being honest, Tommy. I’m not upset about the toy — I’m proud you told the truth.”\n\nThey fixed the toy car together, and Tommy felt proud every time he saw it.\n\n---\n\n**Moral:**\n🚗 *Being honest, even when it’s hard, builds trust and makes you feel happy inside.*"
