    "gemini-2.5": "## Neon Glow (A Friendship Anthem)\n\n(Verse 1)\nAnother Friday night, the kitchen light is low\nWe're gathered 'round the table, watchin' memories grow\nRemember shaky starts, the awkward 'hello' days?\nNow we finish every thought in a million different ways\nWe don't need fancy plans or a stage to shine upon\nJust a simple, silly moment from dusk 'til early dawn.\n\n(Pre-Chorus)\nThe beat is in our hearts, the rhythm's in our feet\nWhen the world gets heavy, you're the melody so sweet\nNo mountain too high, no shadow too deep\nIt's the promises we made that we always keep.\n\n(Chorus)\nOh, this **joy** is a bright, electric thing\nIt's the laughter that only your voice can bring\nWe're lit up like a billboard on a summer street\nIn this moment, nothing could ever feel more complete.\nYeah, we're dancin' in the **neon glow**\nThe kind of **friendship** that everybody knows\nHands up high, let the happy feeling flow!\nThis is our anthem, watch us go, go, go!\n\n(Verse 2)\nYou held the flashlight when I was lost in the dark\nThen we blew out the candles and made a brand new mark\nWe share the wins and losses, the big and the small\nYou always catch me before I even start to fall\nIt's not just the big adventures, though we've had a few\nIt's the knowing glance, the comfort, the honest truth in you.\n\n(Bridge)\nYears from now, when the seasons change their tune\nI know we'll still be looking up at the same moon\n'Cause this connection isn't fragile, it's solid gold\nA story that forever deserves to be told.\n\n(Outro)\nGo, go, go! Yeah, watch us shine!\nThis feeling is yours, this feeling is mine.\n(Fade out with repeated 'Neon Glow!')",
