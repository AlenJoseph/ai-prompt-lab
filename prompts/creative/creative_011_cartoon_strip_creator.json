    "gemini-2.5": "That sounds like fun! I'll put on my cartoonist hat. Here is a 6-panel cartoon strip about **Procrastination**.\n\n---\n\n### Characters\n- **Leo:** A young adult with a perpetually worried look and a messy workspace. The protagonist.\n- **The Task:** A stack of papers/a glowing laptop screen labeled 'BIG PROJECT DUE TOMORROW.'\n- **The Brain:** Leo's inner voice/a tiny, mischievous imp sitting on his shoulder.\n\n### Panel Descriptions\n| Panel | Visuals & Emotions | Dialogue |\n| :---: | :--- | :--- |\n| 1 | Day. Leo sitting at desk, staring at The Task. Stressed but determined. | Leo: 'Okay, deep breath. Time to start the BIG PROJECT. Focus!'\n| 2 | Leo stands up, stretching. The Brain gives a sneaky look. | Brain: 'You can't work on an empty stomach. A small snack is a vital first step!'\n| 3 | Leo in the kitchen, happily making a multi-layer sandwich. Task looks forlorn in background. | Leo: '(Mouth full) This sandwich demands my full attention.'\n| 4 | Hours later, night. Leo slumped on couch, scrolling phone. Task glowing on desk. | Task: 'Tick-tock...'\n| 5 | Very late night. Leo frantically typing at desk, dark circles under eyes, coffee cups everywhere. Brain looks exhausted. | Leo: 'WHY didn't I start this earlier? Paying the Procrastination Tax!'\nBrain: 'Maybe one more check of social media… No! Bad Brain!'\n| 6 | Morning. Leo submits project, relieved but exhausted. Clock shows minute before deadline. | Message: 'The hardest part of any task is starting. Don't wait for the perfect moment.'\n\n---\n\n### Message\nThe hardest part of any task is **starting**. Don’t wait for 'the perfect moment.'",
