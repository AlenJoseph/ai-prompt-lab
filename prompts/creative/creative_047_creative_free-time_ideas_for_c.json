    "gpt-5": "Here are 5 creative ways for children to spend their free time productively, covering learning, DIY, indoor, and outdoor options:\n\n1. Mini Science Experiments\n   - Type: Learning-based / Indoor\n   - Activity: Kids can explore simple science experiments at home, like making a volcano with baking soda and vinegar, growing crystals, or observing plant growth.\n   - Benefit: Encourages curiosity, critical thinking, and hands-on learning.\n\n2. DIY Craft Projects\n   - Type: DIY / Indoor\n   - Activity: Create personalized items like friendship bracelets, paper lanterns, recycled art from old materials, or custom greeting cards.\n   - Benefit: Boosts creativity, fine motor skills, and problem-solving while giving a sense of accomplishment.\n\n3. Nature Treasure Hunt\n   - Type: Outdoor / Learning-based\n   - Activity: Organize a scavenger hunt in the backyard or park, where children search for leaves, rocks, insects, or flowers and identify them.\n   - Benefit: Promotes observation skills, physical activity, and appreciation of nature.\n\n4. Storytelling & Puppet Shows\n   - Type: Indoor / Learning-based\n   - Activity: Children can write short stories and perform them using hand-made puppets or toys. Alternatively, they can record their stories as audio or video.\n   - Benefit: Enhances language skills, imagination, and confidence in public speaking.\n\n5. Mini Gardening Projects\n   - Type: Outdoor / DIY\n   - Activity: Grow small plants in pots or a small garden, experiment with different seeds, or create a DIY terrarium.\n   - Benefit: Teaches responsibility, biology basics, and patience while connecting with nature.",

Home Science Lab Challenge (Learning-based / Indoor)\n   - Activity: Performing simple, safe science experiments using common household materials.\n   - Benefit: Turns playtime into lessons in chemistry and physics, promoting hypothesis creation and observation.\n   - Examples: Volcano eruption (baking soda & vinegar), Lava Lamp (oil, water, food coloring, antacid tablet), Growing Crystals (borax or salt with adult supervision).\n\n2. Story & Sketch Project (Learning-based / Indoor)\n   - Activity: Creating a short, illustrated storybook or comic strip.\n   - Benefit: Develops story structure, creative writing, and drawing skills.\n   - DIY Idea: Use construction paper for pages, staple together, add a dust jacket or About the Author page.\n\n3. Fort & Habitat Building (DIY / Indoor-Outdoor)\n   - Activity: Build forts using blankets, chairs, and pillows indoors or sticks and ropes outdoors.\n   - Benefit: Encourages spatial reasoning, problem-solving, and basic engineering skills.\n   - DIY Idea: Add working doors or simple security features.\n\n4. Community Cleanup & Nature Art (Outdoor / Learning-based)\n   - Activity: Supervised park cleanup followed by creating temporary art from natural objects.\n   - Benefit: Promotes civic responsibility, environmental awareness, and creativity.\n   - Example: Use leaves, pebbles, pinecones to create a symmetrical mosaic.\n\n5. Upcycled Invention Challenge (DIY / Indoor)\n   - Activity: Use household materials to design and build new inventions.\n   - Benefit: Teaches upcycling, design thinking, and problem-solving.\n   - Challenge Ideas: Move a marble from point A to B, create clever storage, or design a simple musical instrument.",
