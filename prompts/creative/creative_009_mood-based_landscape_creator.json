    "gpt-5": "Here’s a detailed descriptive landscape based on your prompt:\n\n---\n\nThe scene opens with a **still mountain lake**, its surface like a polished mirror, reflecting the surrounding peaks and forests with crystal clarity. The **mist clings gently to the shoreline**, curling around smooth stones and fallen logs, giving the edges of the water a soft, ethereal boundary.\n\n**Pine forests** rise on either side of the lake, their dark green needles dense and vibrant, creating a natural frame. Sunlight filters through the trees in golden shafts, catching droplets of lingering dew, casting tiny prisms across the forest floor.\n\nIn the distance, **snow-capped peaks** tower majestically, their white summits glowing faintly with the pale pink and lavender hues of early morning. Shadows stretch long across the valleys, emphasizing the rugged contours and the serene stillness of the highlands.\n\nThe **sky is a soft gradient**, from warm peach near the horizon to a delicate blue overhead, scattered with wisps of clouds that catch the morning light. The entire scene exudes a **peaceful, contemplative atmosphere**, where time seems to pause, and the only sounds are the whisper of wind through the pines and the occasional ripple of a fish breaking the lake’s surface.\n\nColors are **muted but harmonious**: deep greens, soft blues, and gentle neutrals of the rocks and shoreline, punctuated by the bright white of distant snow. The lighting is **soft and diffused**, creating a tranquil glow that envelopes the scene in serenity.\n\n---\n\nIf desired, this description can be turned into a visual prompt for AI image generation, optimized to produce a photorealistic or painterly mountain lake scene.",
    "gemini-2.5": "Sure! Here's a landscape that captures the serene mood with a mountain lake scene, surrounding pine forests, distant snow-capped peaks, and a misty shoreline:\n\nThe scene is bathed in the soft, diffused light of early morning. A gentle mist hangs over the tranquil lake, its surface like a mirror reflecting the silhouettes of towering pine trees that line the shore. The colors are muted yet vibrant: deep greens of the pines, hints of autumn gold in the underbrush, and the majestic, almost ethereal whites and blues of the distant snow-capped peaks. The air feels cool and crisp, carrying the faint scent of pine needles and damp earth. There's a profound stillness, broken only by the occasional ripple on the lake's surface and the distant call of a bird, enhancing the overall atmosphere of peace and solitude.",
    "claude-3": "I've created a serene mountain lake landscape for you. Here's what captures the peaceful mood:\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:**\nThe scene is bathed in soft, early-morning or twilight light with a pale blue sky transitioning to warm, peachy tones—creating that golden-hour serenity. The lighting is diffused and gentle, suggesting mist and atmospheric haze that softens all edges.\n\n**Colors:**\nThe palette uses cool, soothing tones: pale blues and lavenders in the sky, soft whites and pale grays for the distant snow-capped peaks, deep forest greens for the pine trees, and a tranquil gradient of blues in the lake reflecting the sky. Warm peachy undertones add subtle warmth without breaking the calm.\n\n**Main Subject - The Lake:**\nThe crystalline water is the focal point, rendered with gentle ripples and subtle waves that animate softly. The water reflects the sky above, creating a mirror-like quality that enhances the sense of stillness and contemplation.\n\n**Surrounding Elements:**\nDense pine forests frame both sides of the composition, their dark silhouettes providing visual anchoring and depth. The distant snow-capped peaks rise majestically in the background, softened by atmospheric mist to feel distant and dreamlike. The misty shoreline creates a soft transition between land and water, with ethereal fog effects that blur the boundaries and enhance the tranquil mood.\n\nThe overall effect is one of peaceful solitude—a place where time seems to slow down."
