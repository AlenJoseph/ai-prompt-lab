    "gpt-5": "Here’s a structured guide on developing reading skills from a very young age, with practical tips for **teachers**, **parents**, and **students**:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Teachers\n\nTeachers play a crucial role in fostering early literacy. Strategies include:\n\n### Classroom Strategies\n\n* **Read aloud daily:** Model expressive reading and demonstrate how to follow text with eyes.\n* **Use phonics instruction:** Teach letter sounds systematically to help children decode words.\n* **Incorporate sight words:** Introduce high-frequency words to improve fluency.\n* **Create a print-rich environment:** Label classroom objects, display charts, posters, and a variety of books.\n* **Interactive storytelling:** Encourage children to predict endings, act out stories, or discuss characters.\n* **Small group reading:** Offer differentiated instruction based on reading levels.\n* **Encourage questioning:** Ask “why” and “how” questions about texts to develop comprehension.\n* **Use multisensory approaches:** Combine visual, auditory, and kinesthetic activities (tracing letters, clapping syllables, drawing story scenes).\n\n### Assessment and Feedback\n\n* Regularly track progress with reading logs, observations, and simple assessments.\n* Give positive reinforcement and celebrate milestones to motivate young readers.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Parents\n\nParents can reinforce reading skills at home and make reading a natural, enjoyable habit.\n\n### Home Reading Tips\n\n* **Start early:** Even infants benefit from listening to stories or rhymes.\n* **Read together daily:** Shared reading strengthens vocabulary, comprehension, and attention.\n* **Choose age-appropriate books:** Picture books, board books, and simple storybooks for beginners.\n* **Model reading:** Let children see adults reading newspapers, books, or magazines.\n* **Discuss books:** Ask questions about the story, pictures, or characters to improve comprehension.\n* **Encourage storytelling:** Let children narrate their own stories or retell familiar ones.\n* **Make it interactive:** Use finger-pointing, gestures, and voice modulation to make reading fun.\n* **Limit screen distractions:** Encourage focused reading time.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Students (Young Learners)\n\nEven very young children can actively develop their reading skills with guided practice.\n\n### Practical Student Activities\n\n* **Alphabet play:** Sing songs, play letter-matching games, or use flashcards.\n* **Read aloud with parent/teacher:** Follow along and repeat words or phrases.\n* **Word recognition games:** Spot words on signs, packaging, or in books.\n* **Picture reading:** Describe images and connect them to words.\n* **Story acting:** Act out favorite stories or scenes to reinforce comprehension.\n* **Journaling/drawing:** Draw and label pictures to link words and meaning.\n* **Daily reading habit:** Start with short, enjoyable reading sessions (5–15 minutes).\n\n---\n\n### Key Principles for All\n\n* **Consistency matters:** Daily exposure builds fluency and confidence.\n* **Make reading fun:** Games, songs, and playful interactions enhance learning.\n* **Encourage curiosity:** Let children ask questions and explore their interests.\n* **Positive reinforcement:** Celebrate effort, not just accuracy.",
    
    "gemini-2.5": "Developing strong reading skills from a young age is crucial for a child's overall academic success and lifelong learning. It is a shared responsibility among teachers, parents, and the child.\n\n---\n\n## Early Reading Development: The Foundation\n\nReading development begins long before a child can decode words. It starts with **language exposure** and **print awareness**.\n\n* **Birth to Age 3:** Focus on building vocabulary and phonological awareness (hearing and playing with sounds in words). Reading aloud, talking, and singing are essential.\n* **Age 3 to 5 (Preschool):** Introduce the alphabet, letter sounds (**phonics**), and the understanding that print carries meaning. Continue daily reading and encourage book interaction.\n* **Early Elementary (Ages 5+):** Teach phonics, blending sounds, and sight words. Focus on **decoding**, **fluency**, and **comprehension**.\n\n---\n\n## Practical Tips for Teachers\n\n| Strategy | Actionable Tip |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Systematic Phonics** | Teach letter-sound relationships daily using multisensory approaches (tactile letters, movement). |\n| **Modeled & Repeated Reading** | Use **choral reading** or **echo reading** and have students reread texts to build fluency. |\n| **Vocabulary Instruction** | Pre-teach new words, use visual aids, and encourage usage in discussions. |\n| **Comprehension Strategies** | Teach active reading: predict, question, visualize, summarize. |\n| **Book Choice** | Provide a variety of genres and levels; let students choose books to boost motivation. |\n\n---\n\n## Practical Tips for Parents\n\n| Strategy | Actionable Tip |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Establish a Routine** | Read daily at a consistent time. 10–15 minutes is effective. |\n| **Read Aloud** | Use expression and different voices. Read books above child's level for vocabulary exposure. |\n| **Interactive Reading** | Ask open-ended questions to develop comprehension. |\n| **Model Reading** | Show that adults read for pleasure and information. |\n| **Utilize Environmental Print** | Point out letters and words in everyday surroundings. |\n| **Visit the Library** | Make library trips a fun, regular activity. |\n\n---\n\n## Practical Tips for Students\n\n| Strategy | Actionable Tip |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Read Out Loud** | Practice daily to improve fluency and pronunciation. |\n| **Re-read Difficult Sections** | Revisit confusing parts to ensure understanding. |\n| **Be a Word Detective** | Use context to infer new words, keep a personal vocabulary list. |\n| **Visualize the Story** | Picture the story in your mind; optionally draw scenes. |\n| **Choose Books You Enjoy** | Pick topics that interest you to stay motivated.",
    
    "claude-3": "# Developing Reading Skills from a Young Age\n\nReading development begins long before children encounter formal instruction. Early literacy skills are built through consistent exposure to language, stories, and print in engaging contexts.\n\n## Foundation: Early Language Development\n\nThe groundwork for reading starts with oral language skills. Young children who have rich conversations, hear stories read aloud, and are exposed to varied vocabulary develop stronger reading foundations. Everyday interactions—talking during meals, narrating activities, responding to curiosity—help build these skills.\n\n## For Teachers\n\n* Create a print-rich classroom environment with letters, words, and books visible.\n* Read aloud daily with engaging stories that introduce new vocabulary and concepts.\n* Use phonological awareness activities (rhyming games, syllable clapping, alliteration) before focusing on letter-sound relationships.\n* Teach letter recognition and phonics systematically, connecting sounds to meaningful words.\n* Allow independent exploration of books; use guided reading groups for targeted instruction.\n* Incorporate writing activities to connect spoken sounds to written symbols.\n* Model reading by reading for pleasure yourself.\n\n## For Parents\n\n* Read to your child every day, even for 10–15 minutes.\n* Let your child choose books and welcome repeated readings.\n* Talk constantly about daily activities and label objects to build vocabulary.\n* Point out print in the environment and make it a game.\n* Create a cozy reading space and establish a consistent reading routine.\n* Ask questions while reading to develop comprehension.\n* Avoid pressuring reading; keep it enjoyable.\n\n## For Students\n\n* Read with expression and different voices.\n* Predict story outcomes and celebrate attempts, even if imperfect.\n* Choose books that genuinely interest you.\n* Focus on understanding, not perfection in pronunciation.\n* Re-read favorite books to build fluency and comprehension.\n* Ask questions when unclear and discuss stories with others.\n\n## Keys to Success\n\n* Consistency over intensity: short daily reading sessions are more effective than occasional long sessions.\n* Keep reading joyful and pressure-free.\n* Recognize developmental readiness varies; individual differences are normal."
