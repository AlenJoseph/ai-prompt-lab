    "gpt-5": "Here’s a detailed example for a tech startup logo in a minimalist geometric style:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Symbol Ideas\n- **Abstract Cube / Hexagon:** A geometric cube or hexagon composed of clean lines, representing structure, modularity, and digital innovation.\n- **Interconnected Nodes / Circuit Lines:** Minimal dots and lines forming a network, symbolizing connectivity, tech infrastructure, and reliability.\n- **Monoline Lettermark:** The first letter of the brand name, stylized using continuous geometric lines, creating a modern, sleek identity.\n- **Minimal Lightning Bolt / Forward Arrow:** A subtle arrow or bolt integrated into the geometry to convey speed, progress, and forward-thinking.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Meaning Behind the Logo Choices\n- **Cube / Hexagon:** Suggests stability, balance, and innovation. Hexagons are common in tech design for representing efficiency (like honeycomb structures).\n- **Nodes / Circuit Lines:** Reflect the startup’s technological foundation, data connectivity, and networked solutions.\n- **Monoline Lettermark:** Creates a strong, memorable brand identity with simplicity, emphasizing modernity and minimalism.\n- **Arrow / Lightning Bolt:** Highlights agility, progress, and the startup’s drive to innovate.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How the Logo Represents the Brand\n- **Innovation:** The abstract, geometric shapes convey creativity and forward-thinking design.\n- **Reliability:** Symmetrical and balanced structures communicate trustworthiness and stability.\n- **Simplicity:** Minimal lines and shapes make the logo versatile for digital platforms, app icons, and small-scale use.\n- **Digital-Friendly:** The geometric style scales well for app icons, website favicons, and social media, maintaining recognizability.\n\n---\n\n**Example Visualization Concept:**\n- **Primary shape:** Interconnected hexagon with a monoline “S” inside (if the startup name starts with S).\n- **Colors:** Deep blue or teal for trust + gradient accents for innovation.\n- **Application:** Works as a standalone icon for apps, and also alongside the brand name in marketing materials.",
    
    "gemini-2.5": "Here are some ideas for your tech startup logo, focusing on innovation, reliability, and simplicity with a minimalist geometric style:\n\n**Symbol Idea 1: Intersecting Triangles**\n- **Description:** Two equilateral triangles, one slightly rotated and intersecting the other, forming a stylized letter 'A' or an abstract upward arrow.\n- **Meaning:** Innovation (upward momentum), Reliability (triangles are stable shapes), Simplicity (only two shapes used).\n- **Representation:** Communicates modernity, efficiency, and connectivity.\n\n**Symbol Idea 2: Evolving Hexagon**\n- **Description:** A hexagon with a slightly smaller, rotated hexagon inside or extended sides, creating depth.\n- **Meaning:** Innovation (adaptability), Reliability (robust hexagon structure), Simplicity (still a clean geometric shape).\n- **Representation:** Brand built on solid foundations but dynamic and forward-thinking.\n\n**Symbol Idea 3: Connected Grid / Node**\n- **Description:** Central dot with 3-4 lines extending outward, optionally ending in smaller dots.\n- **Meaning:** Innovation (networking), Reliability (central node is stable), Simplicity (basic lines and dots).\n- **Representation:** Shows connectivity, data flow, and problem-solving in tech solutions.",
    
    "claude-3": "# Logo Design Concept for Your Tech Startup\n\n## Symbol Ideas\n1. **Ascending Hexagon / Stacked Geometric Shapes** – Interlocking hexagons or layers building upward. Symbolizes efficiency, structured complexity, and growth.\n2. **Interconnected Nodes with a Core** – Small circles connected by lines, representing data connectivity, networks, and interconnection.\n3. **Forward Arrow / Chevron in Geometric Form** – Stylized arrow using clean lines to suggest progress and direction.\n4. **Minimalist Sphere with Dimension** – Sphere with 2-3 lines suggesting depth, unity, and reliability.\n\n## Meaning Behind These Choices\n- **Innovation:** Geometric shapes represent precision and forward-thinking.\n- **Reliability:** Symmetry and balance imply dependability.\n- **Simplicity:** Minimal elements ensure scalability and recognizability.\n\n## How the Logo Represents the Brand (Example: Interconnected Nodes)\n- **Full size:** Shows 5-7 nodes connected, dynamic and intelligent.\n- **Icon size:** Recognizable at 64x64px.\n- **Monochrome:** Maintains impact in single color.\n- **Brand story:** 'Nodes connecting to create something greater', representing the company as a hub connecting users and systems."
