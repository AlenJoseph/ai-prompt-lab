    "gpt-5":"The sunset drapes the sky in molten amber, as if the day itself were sighing before surrender. The air tastes of salt and stillness — a pause between heartbeats. Clouds blush into coral, then bleed softly into violet, like secrets dissolving into dusk. The sun sinks slowly, reluctant to let go, its last light brushing the world with tenderness. Somewhere, waves applaud the fading fire, and the horizon hums with quiet goodbyes.",
    "gemini-2.5":"Okay, I shall endeavor to capture the fleeting beauty of a sunset through a poet's eye, weaving in sensory details and emotional resonance.The day, a weary traveler, begins its slow descent,And light, once bold and brazen, now grows soft and spent.A hush descends upon the world, a whispered, gentle sigh,As golden rays ignite the clouds that drift across the sky.The air, it cools, a silken touch on skin that felt the sun,A sweet perfume of twilight blooms, its evening song begun.The scent of earth, of distant dew, a promise in the breeze,As shadows stretch their fingers long amongst the restless trees.The canvas shifts, from fiery gold to shades of tangerine,Then blushing rose and lavender, a breathtaking, serene Procession of dissolving hues, where crimson bleeds to plum,A silent, solemn majesty, before the dark will come.My heart, it aches with fragile joy, a bittersweet release,To watch the dying light embrace the world in perfect peace.A yearning for the day to stay, this splendor to prolong,Yet solace in the fading glow, where memories belong.And as the last bright ember sinks beneath the distant line,A whisper of the coming stars, a cosmic, deep design,Leaves but a lingering memory, a warmth upon the soul,Of beauty born of ending, making weary spirits whole.Here's an image that might capture such a scene:`http://googleusercontent.com/image_generation_content/0",
    "claude-3":"The sun descends like a dying flame, casting the sky into a symphony of amber, rose, and violet. The horizon bleeds gold, as if the earth itself is weeping with the day's final breath. Above, clouds become brushstrokes of crimson and magenta—nature's masterpiece painted for an audience of one, or perhaps for no one at all.The air cools against your skin, a gentle mercy after the day's heat. There is a softness to it, a whisper that speaks of endings and the quiet peace that comes with them. You can almost taste the sweetness of it—honeyed light mixing with the earthy scent of cooling grass and distant rain.The world slows. Birds sing their farewell songs, their voices tinged with both celebration and melancholy. Trees stand as silent witnesses, their leaves turned to copper by the fading light. Everything glows from within, as if touched by something sacred and ancient.In your chest, something stirs—a bittersweet ache. The sunset speaks of impermanence, of how all things, no matter how beautiful, must fade. Yet there is comfort in this truth. The day dies, yes, but it dies gloriously, burning bright until its very last moment. And tomorrow, the sun will rise again.You stand suspended between light and shadow, between what was and what will be. The sunset holds you in this liminal space—vulnerable, small, yet somehow held by something vast and eternal. In this moment, you are both infinitely insignificant and deeply, profoundly alive."
