    "gpt-5": "# Subtitle-generation prompt + instructions (ready-to-use)\n\nBelow is a single, copy-pasteable prompt you can send to a transcription/translation/LLM pipeline (or use as a spec for building one). It follows your four steps: detect spoken language → translate to target → align subtitles → output `.srt`. It includes sensible defaults, options, examples, and quality checks.\n\n---\n\n### Prompt template\n\n```\nTASK\nYou are an automated subtitle generator. Given an audio/video file (or a transcript with timestamps), produce high-quality subtitles in .srt format in the requested target language.\n\nGOAL\n1) Detect the spoken language(s) automatically.\n2) Transcribe the spoken audio into the detected source language with timestamps.\n3) If the target language differs from the detected source, translate the transcription into the target language while preserving proper nouns, named entities, and on-screen terminology (offer transliteration where needed).\n4) Align translations precisely to the dialogue and output a valid .srt file ready for use.\n\nINPUT\n- {audio_or_transcript}: either the raw audio/video (if available) or an existing timestamped transcript.\n- {target_language}: the language to produce subtitles in (e.g., \"English\", \"Spanish\", \"hi-IN\"). If empty, default to the detected spoken language (no translation).\n- Optional flags:\n  - {dual_language} = true|false — if true, produce bilingual subtitles (original on first line, translation on second).\n  - {max_chars_per_line} = 42\n  - {max_lines_per_sub} = 2\n  - {max_duration_seconds} = 7.0 — max duration for a single subtitle\n  - {min_duration_seconds} = 0.5\n  - {merge_gap_seconds} = 0.12 — merge segments separated by <= this silence\n  - {reading_speed_cps} = 22 — characters per second reading speed threshold\n\nINSTRUCTIONS (step-by-step)\nA. LANGUAGE DETECTION\n  1. Analyze the audio to detect the primary spoken language and any language switches. Output the detected language(s) with confidence scores.\n  2. If detection confidence for the primary language < 0.65, mark \"LANGUAGE_UNCERTAIN\" and continue with best-effort transcription but include a top-line note in the output.\n\nB. TRANSCRIPTION\n  1. Perform accurate speech-to-text with word-level timestamps if possible. Include punctuation and common disfluency cleanup (remove filler words only if they do not change meaning).\n  2. Tag non-speech sounds and important on-screen audio in square brackets, e.g. [music], [applause], [door slams].\n  3. Keep speaker changes as `Speaker 1:`, `Speaker 2:` if multiple voices are clearly distinct.\n\nC. TRANSLATION\n  1. Translate the transcribed segments to {target_language} preserving names/brands. If target script differs (e.g., Latin→Devanagari), provide transliteration in parentheses when a proper noun would otherwise be unknown to viewers.\n  2. Respect cultural localization (dates, units) only if user asked; otherwise use literal translation and preserve original numeric formats.\n\nD. ALIGNMENT & SUBTITLE RULES\n  1. Split text into subtitle blocks obeying:\n     - ≤ {max_chars_per_line} characters per line (prefer ~35 for readability).\n     - ≤ {max_lines_per_sub} lines per block.\n     - Respect natural breath/phrase boundaries when possible.\n  2. Assign start/end times using speech timestamps:\n     - Start = segment start or merged-start if merging adjacent segments.\n     - End = segment end but enforce min/max durations ({min_duration_seconds}, {max_duration_seconds}).\n     - If a block would exceed max_duration, split across multiple sequential subtitle items with proper timestamps.\n  3. Merge adjacent short segments when gap ≤ {merge_gap_seconds} and combined duration ≤ {max_duration_seconds}.\n  4. Prevent overlapping subtitles. If overlap unavoidable, adjust end time of earlier subtitle to start_time_next - 0.02s minimum gap.\n\nE. READABILITY & SPEED CHECK\n  1. Compute chars-per-second (CPS) for each subtitle: CPS = characters_in_subtitle ÷ duration_seconds.\n  2. If CPS > {reading_speed_cps}, shorten the subtitle by:\n     - Splitting into more subtitles (if possible) OR\n     - Pruning non-essential parentheticals and filler words.\n  3. Flag remaining high-CPS subtitles with `[#SPEED_WARNING]` as a fallback.\n\nF. FORMATTING RULES FOR .srt\n  - Use standard SRT timecode format: `HH:MM:SS,mmm` (comma for milliseconds).\n  - No HTML tags. Use plain text; for emphasis use ALL CAPS sparingly only for shouts.\n  - Include only the translated text (unless {dual_language}=true then:\n       Line 1: ORIGINAL (source language)\n       Line 2: TRANSLATION (target language))\n  - Include speaker label at the beginning of a subtitle block only when necessary: `Speaker 2: <text>`.\n  - Include non-speech cues in brackets on their own subtitle line when they occur without speech.\n\nG. OUTPUT\n  1. Produce a valid .srt file with sequential numbers starting at 1.\n  2. At the top output a small JSON metadata block in comments (not required by players but helpful), e.g.:\n     /* { \"detected_language\": \"fr\", \"detected_confidence\": 0.96, \"target_language\": \"English\", \"dual_language\": false } */\n  3. After the .srt content, provide a short quality summary listing:\n     - total subtitles\n     - any LANGUAGE_UNCERTAIN flag\n     - number of SPEED_WARNING flags, if any\n     - suggestions for manual review (e.g., proper nouns, overlapping, music cues)\n\nEXAMPLES\n- Example input: short sentence with timestamps:\n    [00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.800] \"Bonjour tout le monde\"\n  If {target_language} = \"English\", produce:\n    1\n    00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,800\n    Hello everyone\n\n- Example bilingual block when {dual_language}=true:\n    1\n    00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,800\n    Bonjour tout le monde\n    Hello everyone\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n- If audio is extremely noisy or transcription confidence < 0.5 for many segments, still output .srt but include a clear \"LOW_TRANSCRIPTION_CONFIDENCE\" note in metadata and mark low-confidence lines with [#LOW_CONFIDENCE].\n- For long continuous monologues, aim for subtitle lengths that maintain CPS <= {reading_speed_cps}. Prefer splitting at punctuation (.,?!) and conjunctions.\n- Provide transliteration option: when {transliterate=true}, append transliteration of foreign proper nouns in parentheses.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT\nReturn only the .srt content and the metadata comment block, followed by the short quality summary. Do not return raw transcripts unless requested.\n\nEND OF PROMPT\n```\n\n---\n\n### Quick clarifications / recommended defaults\n* `max_chars_per_line`: 42 (use ~35 for mobile)\n* `max_lines_per_sub`: 2\n* `max_duration_seconds`: 7.0\n* `min_duration_seconds`: 0.5\n* `merge_gap_seconds`: 0.12\n* `reading_speed_cps`: 22 (lower for subtitles intended for children)\n* `dual_language`: false\n* `transliterate`: true\n\n---\n\n### Sample output (.srt)\n```\n/* {\"detected_language\":\"fr\",\"detected_confidence\":0.97,\"target_language\":\"English\",\"dual_language\":false} */\n\n1\n00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,800\nHello everyone\n\n2\n00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,400\n[door slams]\n\n3\n00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,100\nSpeaker 2: Are you coming with me?\n```\n\nQuality summary:\n- total_subtitles: 3\n- LANGUAGE_UNCERTAIN: false\n- SPEED_WARNING_count: 0\n- Manual review suggestions: check proper noun \"Jean-Luc\" for transliteration; review music segments.\n",
