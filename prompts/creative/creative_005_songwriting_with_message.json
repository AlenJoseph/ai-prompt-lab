    "gpt-5": "Here’s a full pop song I’ve crafted for you about overcoming challenges, with a catchy rhyme, rhythm, and an uplifting message:\n\n---\n\n**Title:** *Rise Again*\n\n**Verse 1:**\nWoke up to the storm outside,\nShadows tried to steal my light.\nHeart was heavy, feet were slow,\nBut I’m not letting go tonight.\n\n**Pre-Chorus:**\nEvery fall just makes me stronger,\nEvery doubt won’t hold me longer.\nI hear a voice, it calls my name,\nTelling me I’ll play this game.\n\n**Chorus:**\nI’ll rise again, through fire and rain,\nShake off the hurt, embrace the pain.\nNo mountain high, no valley low,\nCan keep me down, I’ll steal the show.\nI’ll rise again, I’ll rise again!\n\n**Verse 2:**\nBroken dreams and whispered lies,\nTried to chain me, clip my wings.\nBut I’m a fighter, hear me roar,\nThis is my time, I’ll soar once more.\n\n**Pre-Chorus:**\nEvery scar tells a story true,\nEvery tear led me to you.\nI see the sun breaking through,\nA brighter world in every hue.\n\n**Chorus:**\nI’ll rise again, through fire and rain,\nShake off the hurt, embrace the pain.\nNo mountain high, no valley low,\nCan keep me down, I’ll steal the show.\nI’ll rise again, I’ll rise again!\n\n**Bridge:**\nOh-oh-oh, nothing’s gonna stop me,\nOh-oh-oh, I’m rewriting my story.\nTurn the page, feel the glory,\nI’m alive, it’s my victory!\n\n**Chorus:**\nI’ll rise again, through fire and rain,\nShake off the hurt, embrace the pain.\nNo mountain high, no valley low,\nCan keep me down, I’ll steal the show.\nI’ll rise again, I’ll rise again!\n\n**Outro:**\nI’ll rise, I’ll rise,\nHigher than the skies,\nI’ll rise again…\n\n---\n\nThe rhythm is designed to fit a driving pop beat, with a strong, anthemic chorus that sticks in your head. 🎵",
    
    "gemini-2.5": "That's a fantastic idea! I can certainly write a pop song about **overcoming challenges**. Pop music thrives on upbeat energy and relatable themes, and a message of resilience fits perfectly.\n\nHere is a song called **\"Concrete Bloom\"**:\n\n---\n\n## 🎶 Concrete Bloom 🎶\n\n**(Genre: Pop)**\n\n### (Verse 1)\nSunrise hitting cold gray glass, another day begins too fast\nFelt the pressure, couldn't breathe, a heavy weight beneath the sleeve\nTried to run, tried to hide, but the shadow stayed right by my side\nWhispered, \"You won't make the climb,\" lost my footing, lost my time.\n\n### (Pre-Chorus)\nBut a little voice kept saying, **\"No,\"** you're stronger than you think, you know\nGotta crack the pavement, gotta break the mold\nReady now to watch the story unfold.\n\n### (Chorus)\nI'm a **Concrete Bloom**, yeah, I pushed right through the stone\nBuilt myself a fortress on a foundation I call my own\nUsed the fire to forge the steel, the cuts and bruises help me feel\nThis is the rhythm, this is the beat, can't be stopped, can't be beat!\n\n### (Verse 2)\nRemember nights I walked alone, felt like I was miles from home\nEvery setback, every fall, echoed heavy in the hall\nBut you learn to stand up taller, you get smarter, you get smaller\nFocus just on the next step, no more crying, no more prep.\n\n### (Pre-Chorus)\n'Cause a little voice kept saying, **\"Go!\"** you're stronger than you think, you know\nGotta crack the pavement, gotta break the mold\nReady now to watch the story unfold.\n\n### (Chorus)\nI'm a **Concrete Bloom**, yeah, I pushed right through the stone\nBuilt myself a fortress on a foundation I call my own\nUsed the fire to forge the steel, the cuts and bruises help me feel\nThis is the rhythm, this is the beat, can't be stopped, can't be beat!\n\n### (Bridge)\nIt's not about the perfect path, it's shaking off the aftermath\nTaking every single fear, and holding nothing back right here.\nThe view from up here is so clear... **(Rise)**\n\n### (Instrumental/Dance Break - *Upbeat synth and driving drum pattern*)\n\n### (Chorus)\nI'm a **Concrete Bloom**, yeah, I pushed right through the stone\nBuilt myself a fortress on a foundation I call my own\nUsed the fire to forge the steel, the cuts and bruises help me feel\nThis is the rhythm, this is the beat, can't be stopped, can't be beat!\n\n### (Outro)\nOh, I pushed right through... the stone!\nI'm a **Concrete Bloom**... and I finally grew!\n\n---\n\n### 📝 The Message in the Song\nThe core message is one of **resilience** and **inner strength**.\n* It encourages the listener to see challenges not as stopping points, but as opportunities to grow.\n* Emphasizes that true growth comes from overcoming difficulty, using hardships as part of your personal foundation.",
