    "gpt-5": "The first light stretches across the horizon, brushing the sea with threads of gold. The waves murmur softly, as if whispering secrets to the shore. I can **see** the sun rising slowly, a molten ember melting into the sky, painting clouds in hues of peach and rose. The **sound** of the tide is steady, rhythmic—a heartbeat of the earth itself.\n\nThe **smell** of salt drifts in the cool morning air, mingling with the faint scent of seaweed and the promise of a new day. Beneath my feet, the **touch** of sand is cool and damp, grains clinging to my skin like tiny memories. When I **taste** the air, it is crisp and pure, carrying a tang of ocean spray and freedom.\n\nA quiet peace settles within me—**hope**, gentle and radiant, rises with the sun. The world feels reborn in this moment, as if all sorrows have been washed clean by the tide. The scene hums with life, yet it whispers stillness. It is both a **beginning and a blessing**, a silent reminder that beauty often arrives softly, wrapped in the calm of dawn.",
    "gemini-2.5": "Ah, what a beautiful scene to capture! Here is a description of the sunrise over a quiet beach, engaging all five senses and emotional depth.\n\n---\n\n## 🌅 A Symphony of the Dawn\n\nThe air hangs cool and still, a velvet cloak just before the world awakens. You **taste** the clean, crisp **salinity** on your lips, a subtle, metallic tang that promises the vastness of the ocean. It mixes faintly with the memory of sweet, dewy night air, like a sip of cold, unblemished water.\n\nA deep, resonant **sound** begins to stir—not a crash, but the endless, rhythmic **hush and pull** of the tide. It’s a sonic breath, an **oceanic metronome**, overlaid by the distant, lonely *caw* of a single gull circling the nascent light. The sand under your bare feet feels impossibly **cool and fine**; a silken powder giving way slightly with each step, a comforting **touch** against the residual warmth of your skin.\n\nThe rising light is a slow, breathtaking drama for the **eyes**. At first, the eastern horizon is merely a bruise of deep violet and indigo. Then, a single, searing **line of gold** splits the darkness, pushing up threads of apricot, rose, and brilliant tangerine that **bleed** across the sky. The smooth, wet sand mirrors this firework display, becoming a liquid, shimmering canvas of color.\n\nAnd as the sun finally clears the horizon, a slow, deep **fragrance** arrives. It’s the earthy **smell** of damp, clean sand warmed by the first rays, mingled with the faint, sharp scent of seaweed and the pure, mineral essence of the open water. This primal aroma washes over you, simple and profoundly real.\n\n---\n\n## 💖 Emotional Resonance: The Heart of the Dawn\n\nThis whole experience is an act of **cleansing**. As the sun’s warmth touches your face—a soft, promised **caress**—a wave of **unburdening peace** washes through you. The sheer scale of the ocean and the majestic, daily ritual of the sunrise evoke a powerful sense of **humility** and **wonder**.\n\nYou feel profoundly **connected**—to the earth, the water, and the cosmic clockwork above. The lingering night shadows, much like lingering worries, recede and vanish in the brilliant light. There is a sense of **hope** in the relentless, reliable return of the day, an ancient promise whispered on the sea breeze: *“Begin again.”* It’s a feeling of **solitude** that is not lonely, but **sacred**—a perfect stillness where everything you need is right here, right now.",
    "claude-3": "# Sunrise Over a Quiet Beach\n\nThe horizon bleeds into existence—first a whisper of amber, then a crescendo of gold that shatters the darkness like stained glass coming alive. The sun rises in deliberate, breath-taking stages, each moment heavier with color than the last: coral fading to rose, rose deepening to crimson, crimson surrendering to the blinding white of pure light.\n\nThe air tastes of salt and memory, sharp and clean on your tongue, carrying the mineral essence of the ocean itself. It fills your lungs with each inhale, grounding you in this singular, irretrievable moment. There is a freshness here that feels almost medicinal—as if the world has been scrubbed clean while you slept, and you alone have been invited to witness its renewal.\n\nSand shifts beneath your bare feet, still cool from the night, each grain a tiny point of contact anchoring you to the earth. The water laps gently at the shore in a rhythm as old as time—*in and out, in and out*—a pulse that syncs with your own heartbeat until you can no longer tell where the world ends and you begin. When the waves touch your skin, they bring both the shock of cold and a strange, ancient comfort.\n\nThe sound is almost silence—yet not quite. Waves whisper rather than roar, their susurrant murmur like distant conversations you've forgotten. A single gull cries out, lonely and defiant. The soft percussion of your own footsteps in wet sand becomes part of the symphony. There is a hush here, a sacred quiet that makes you feel as though you're listening to something you were never meant to hear.\n\nWhat washes over you in these moments is not joy exactly—something deeper and more complex. It is the ache of beauty that cannot be held, the bittersweet knowledge that this golden light will pass. There is loneliness here, yes, but also profound connection: to the earth, to the endless cycle of days, to something infinite and indifferent that somehow feels like grace. Your chest tightens with gratitude and grief intertwined. You are small, impossibly small—and in that smallness, you are freed."
