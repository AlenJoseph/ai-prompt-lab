# Evaluation Guide

## Introduction

This guide outlines how to evaluate the effectiveness of prompts in the AI Prompt Lab.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Clarity
- Is the prompt easy to understand?
- Are instructions unambiguous?
- Is the expected output clear?

**Rating Scale**: 1-5 (1 = Very unclear, 5 = Crystal clear)

### 2. Specificity
- Does the prompt provide enough detail?
- Are constraints well-defined?
- Is the scope appropriate?

**Rating Scale**: 1-5 (1 = Too vague, 5 = Perfectly specific)

### 3. Effectiveness
- Does it produce the desired results?
- Is the output quality consistent?
- Does it meet the stated objectives?

**Rating Scale**: 1-5 (1 = Poor results, 5 = Excellent results)

### 4. Reusability
- Can the prompt be easily adapted?
- Are variables well-defined?
- Is it template-friendly?

**Rating Scale**: 1-5 (1 = Single-use only, 5 = Highly reusable)

### 5. Efficiency
- Is the prompt concise?
- Does it avoid unnecessary complexity?
- Does it get results quickly?

**Rating Scale**: 1-5 (1 = Inefficient, 5 = Highly efficient)

## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Initial Testing
1. Test the prompt with various inputs
2. Document the outputs
3. Note any inconsistencies

### Step 2: Scoring
Rate the prompt on each criterion (1-5 scale)

### Step 3: Feedback Collection
- User feedback
- Peer reviews
- A/B testing results

### Step 4: Iteration
- Identify weaknesses
- Make improvements
- Retest

## Metrics to Track

1. **Success Rate**: Percentage of times the prompt produces acceptable output
2. **Time to Result**: How quickly the prompt generates useful output
3. **Iteration Count**: Number of refinements needed
4. **User Satisfaction**: Feedback ratings from users
5. **Consistency Score**: How consistent outputs are across different runs

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Inconsistent Outputs
**Solution**: Add more specific constraints and examples

### Issue: Too Verbose
**Solution**: Simplify language, remove redundancy

### Issue: Missing Context
**Solution**: Add relevant background information

### Issue: Poor Quality Results
**Solution**: Refine instructions, add examples, adjust tone

## Best Practices

1. **Test with Edge Cases**: Don't just use typical inputs
2. **Get Multiple Perspectives**: Have others evaluate your prompts
3. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of tests and results
4. **Iterate Systematically**: Make one change at a time
5. **Compare Versions**: A/B test different prompt variations

## Tools for Evaluation

- Automated testing scripts
- User feedback forms
- Analytics dashboards
- Comparison matrices

## Continuous Improvement

Regular evaluation should lead to:
- Updated prompt templates
- Enhanced documentation
- Better categorization
- Improved schema validation
