## How to Contribute

### Ways to Contribute

- Submit new prompts
- Improve existing prompts
- Add documentation
- Report bugs
- Suggest new features
- Improve code quality

## Prompt Submission Guidelines

### 1. Follow the Schema

All prompts must conform to `core/prompt_schema.json`. Use the validator to check:

```python
from core.prompt_validator import PromptValidator

validator = PromptValidator()
is_valid, error = validator.validate_prompt_file("path/to/your/prompt.json")
```

### 2. Choose the Right Category

Place your prompt in the appropriate category:
- `prompts/education/` - Educational and learning prompts
- `prompts/creative/` - Creative writing and artistic prompts
- `prompts/productivity/` - Workflow and productivity prompts
- `prompts/coding/` - Programming and technical prompts

### 3. Naming Convention

- Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames: `essay-writing-assistant.json`
- Include the category in the filename if helpful: `coding-python-debugger.json`

### 4. Required Fields

Every prompt must include:
- `id`: Unique identifier (format: `category-name-###`)
- `title`: Clear, descriptive title
- `category`: One of the four categories
- `description`: Brief explanation of the prompt's purpose
- `prompt`: The actual prompt text

### 5. Optional but Recommended

- `variables`: Define any placeholders in your prompt
- `tags`: Add relevant tags for discoverability
- `examples`: Provide example inputs and outputs

### 6. Quality Standards

- **Clear**: Easy to understand and follow
- **Specific**: Provides enough detail for good results
- **Tested**: You've tested it and it works well
- **Documented**: Includes description and examples

## Code Contribution Guidelines

### Python Code

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Add type hints where appropriate
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

### Example

```python
def validate_prompt(prompt_data: dict) -> tuple[bool, str | None]:
    """
    Validate a prompt against the schema.
    
    Args:
        prompt_data: Dictionary containing prompt data
        
    Returns:
        tuple: (is_valid, error_message)
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

## Documentation Guidelines

### Markdown Files

- Use clear headings and structure
- Include code examples where relevant
- Keep language simple and accessible
- Add links to related resources

### README Updates

If your contribution requires README changes:
- Update the relevant section
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Keep it concise

## Review Process

### What Happens After You Submit

1. **Automated Checks**: Schema validation and linting
2. **Initial Review**: Maintainer reviews your contribution
3. **Feedback**: You may receive suggestions for improvements
4. **Approval**: Once approved, your contribution will be merged
