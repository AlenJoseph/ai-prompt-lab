# Prompt Guide

## Introduction

This guide will help you create effective prompts for AI models. A well-crafted prompt can significantly improve the quality and relevance of AI-generated responses.

## Prompt Structure

A good prompt typically includes:

1. **Context**: Background information or setting
2. **Task**: Clear instruction about what you want
3. **Format**: Specify the desired output format
4. **Constraints**: Any limitations or requirements
5. **Examples**: Sample inputs/outputs (optional but helpful)

## Categories

### Education
Prompts designed for learning, teaching, and educational content.

### Creative
Prompts for creative writing, brainstorming, and artistic content.

### Productivity
Prompts to enhance workflow, organization, and task management.

### Coding
Prompts for code generation, debugging, and technical documentation.

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define what you want
2. **Provide Context**: Give relevant background information
3. **Use Examples**: Show what you're looking for
4. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on results
5. **Test Variations**: Try different approaches
6. **Document**: Keep track of what works
